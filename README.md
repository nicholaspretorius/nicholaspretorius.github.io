My GitHub Page

This is my *very-late-to-the-party* attempt at getting going with GitHub, GitHub Pages and recording what I learn on a daily basis. This site will be a very lo-fi, work in progress. The approach I am taking for now is that [doing is better than donting]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJqr6LBFelI>. So this is it, bare bones. No JS, no CSS, no design. 

Each TIL will be very brief, with relevant links if necessary. I will be experimenting with ~~Jekyll~~ [Gatsby]<https://www.gatsbyjs.org/> in future.

Developed with the help of: Git, GitHub, VS Code.
