# Nicholas Pretorius GitHub Page
Modified Gatsby starter used to run my personal GitHub page inspired by the "Today I Learned" blogs.

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
```
gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`
