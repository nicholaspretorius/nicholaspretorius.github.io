My GitHub Page

This is my very-late-to-the-party attempt at getting going with GitHub and recording what I learn on a daily basis. This site will be a work in progress, so the approach I am taking for now is that doing is better than don't-ing (get it?). So this is it, bare bones. No JS, no CSS, no design. Yet. 

Developed with the help of: Git, GitHub, VS Code.
