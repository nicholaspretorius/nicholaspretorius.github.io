&lt;p&gt;After successfully completing my &lt;a href=&quot;https://confirm.udacity.com/2A67P92L&quot;&gt;React Developer Nanodegree&lt;/a&gt;, I decided it was time to work towards some credentials to put behind my &lt;em&gt;backend&lt;/em&gt; development skills. While I have been developing with Node.js and MongoDB for some time, my JavaScript knowledge, both front-end and back, is mostly self-taught (along with numerous online courses). Apart from long-past project work in PHP and some basics in Java, I have not really dug into another programming language in a meaningful way. While JavaScript works throughout the stack (and I am continually working to improve on it), I felt it was time to learn a new language and to start a journey towards becoming a &lt;em&gt;polyglot developer&lt;/em&gt;. My knowledge of SQL is also limited so this is fantastic opportunity to fill in some of the larger gaps in my working knowledge! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, here are some of my notes I have kept handy for working with Python (assuming Python2 and 3 are installed - depending on your setup):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Command Line.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the command line: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;python --version&lt;/code&gt; displays the Python 2 version number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 --version&lt;/code&gt; displays the Python 3 version number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; enters the Python3 REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip --version&lt;/code&gt; Python Package Installer. Is the equivalent of NPM for Python packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install --upgrade pip&lt;/code&gt; Upgrades pip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in the Python REPL: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressing Ctrl + z will put the running code in the background. (You can enter &lt;code&gt;fg&lt;/code&gt; to bring it back to the foreground).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressing Ctrl + c or Ctrl + d will &apos;kill&apos; the REPL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Running Python Code.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with Python, it is useful to set a Virtual Environment or &apos;venv&apos; to keep version numbers for projects in harmony. (I think of this as keeping a .nvmrc to set the Node version or having an &quot;engine&quot; field in your package.json file):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3.7.4 -m venv env&lt;/code&gt; will setup up the venv. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;course env/bin/activate&lt;/code&gt; will activate (or re-activate the venv)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;deactivate&lt;/code&gt; will deactivate the venv. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flask.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flask is a lightweight framework for Python, primarily for building APIs. (Similar to Express for Node.js):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install Flask&lt;/code&gt; will install Flask from pip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; will write all your dependencies to a requirements.txt file. (Similar to package.json)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install pylint&lt;/code&gt; will install &apos;Pylint&apos; into the venv for development purposes. (In a way, similar to NVM, you can have different dependecies available in your particular project venv)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VS Code.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installed the &quot;autopep8&quot; extension for automatic code formatting for .py files. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installed the &quot;pylint&quot; extension for linting of .py files. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installed the Python extension for overall VS Code improvements for .py files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to dig into this new chapter of development journey! I did start dipping my toe into the water a little while back with this very basic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nicholaspretorius/flask101&quot;&gt;101 API in Flask with SQLite&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might also be a good time to review my &lt;a href=&quot;/til0055/&quot;&gt;Postgres Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt; from a while back...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am familiar with SQL and can read it well enough, I have never really had to work with SQL much (I have built some basic APIs with Node.js/Express and Sequelize). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel with my Full Stack Nanodegree, I am also doing a Udacity short-course called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198&quot;&gt;SQL for Data Analysis&lt;/a&gt; to brush up on my SQL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/nicholaspretorius/d8e7b5712478a26933c6d0e28942381e&quot;&gt;SQL Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt; so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Expo and Detox.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Now that I have some experience creating React end-to-end (e2e) tests with Cypress, I have been looking into ways of doing the same with…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0134/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0134/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Now that I have some experience creating React end-to-end (e2e) tests with Cypress, I have been looking into ways of doing the same with React Native. After some investigation, I found some great resources to get you started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wix/Detox&quot;&gt;Detox&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.logrocket.com/end-to-end-testing-in-react-native-with-detox/&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; by Emanuel Suriano on the LogRocket blog provides a great overview. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a comprehensive overview of the basics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactnativetesting.io/&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; by Josh Justice (great superhero name) is indispensible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running Detox on Expo apps is not exactly the same as with React Native Client though, so the aforementioned Josh Justice has another great article just for that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.expo.io/testing-expo-apps-with-detox-and-react-native-testing-library-7fbdbb82ac87&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, this is a useful answer on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/54834078/4847180&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; on setting up Detox with Expo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Note: I have come across Josh Justice&apos;s work before, and I highly recommend taking a look. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://learntdd.in/react/&quot;&gt;his article&lt;/a&gt; on getting started with React and Cypress that got me going on the basics of e2e testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Expo and Jest.]]></title><description><![CDATA[A few thoughts on Expo and Jest:  Expo.

&lt;h3&gt;Expo.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using Expo with React Native applications, I have found it best to use the LAN option when developing - it is far quicker in my experience than Tunnel. Your device and the machine you are developing need to be on the same network though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that is not working for some reason, I find the LAN option, while preferable, to be a bit more &lt;em&gt;flaky&lt;/em&gt; than Tunnel. The Tunnel option seems to work most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still wish I could use regular browser Dev Tools to inspect layouts though... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jest.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jest runs in &quot;watch&quot; mode by default, as such, if you only want to run Jest once, enter the following into the command line: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CI=true npm test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see your code coverage and only run once, you can do the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CI=true npm test -- --coverage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, I have been working on improving my knowledge of testing in React. I find it useful to have the code coverge open while you develop so that you can catch missing branches as they happen. Might not be the preference for most people, but I find it easier to think about possible solutions at the time of writing the code, rather than having to come back later. Granted, that is probably how most of it will shake out, but it&apos;s worth keeping in mind since it only takes a slight command change to have it available. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ionic React.]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Ionic team has announced  Ionic React !  While Ionic has long been known as an "Angular" framework for building mobile apps using web…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0132/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0132/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Ionic team has announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/announcing-ionic-react/&quot;&gt;Ionic React&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ionic has long been known as an &quot;Angular&quot; framework for building mobile apps using web technology, it looks as though they are expanding beyond their Angular origins. Earlier this year I started experimenting with Ionic and, coming from an Angular background, I enjoyed working with it. After having spent the past few weeks digging into the React and React Native ecosystems, I am very curious how Ionic React will fit into the overall ecosystem. Especially since the combination of React and React Native seem to have both the web and mobile bases covered. As Max Lynch writes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Instead of building an abstraction on top of iOS and Android native UI controls, we wanted to build something that was DOM-native, that would use the standard react-dom library and all the libraries that supported it out of the box, and the decades of existing work around the browser. When we looked at installs for react-dom compared to react-native, it was clear to us that vastly more React development was happening in the browser and on top of the DOM than on top of the native iOS or Android UI systems (16x more, in fact!). That further confirmed our belief that “web devs wanna web dev” and take advantage of their experience and existing library of functionality they’ve built on the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, developers are increasingly interested in Progressive Web Apps, especially in the enterprise. PWAs are, at best, an afterthought in the React Native ecosystem (and actually, not officially supported). In contrast, Ionic Framework is one of the leading PWA solutions and has some of the best performance for PWAs in the entire web ecosystem, thanks in part to our work on our Stencil project which we use to generate highly efficient components under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also heard from a number of developers that wanted to use Ionic React in their existing React Native apps, by building more screens in their app out of a native WebView frame (using Capacitor, more on that in a bit) to move more quickly or enable traditional web developers to work in tandem with the existing native and React Native dev teams.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that explanation, the reason to exist for Ionic React seems to be Ionic&apos;s ability to leverage PWA functionality along with the promise to integrate more web developers into building out React Native apps. That sounds pretty much in-line with the appeal Ionic holds for web developers looking to get into mobile. From a business perspective, this certainly widens the potential customer base for Ionic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking on this announcement, I am reminded that after working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://expo.io/&quot;&gt;Expo&lt;/a&gt; the past few weeks, as a web developer, I do miss being able to use Dev Tools to inspect and manipulate DOM elements... The Expo element inspector leaves me feeling largely unsatisfied. Granted, Expo is solving a different problem in a different way, but working in React Native, because the layout is in Flexbox, I really do miss the Dev Tools! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am most intrigued by is that Ionic React comes with TypeScript baked in which, at a glance, makes Ionic React look quite familiar to someone with experience with Ionic. An Ionic team member has also posted a guide on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/elylucas/adding-ionic-react-to-an-existing-react-project-4kib&quot;&gt;how to integrate Ionic React into an existing React project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to digging into some examples in the near future! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Flexbox Froggy.]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you are looking to learn Flexbox, this is quite a fun game for getting the hang of it:  Flexbox Froggy Granted, it seems very oriented to…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0131/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0131/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to learn Flexbox, this is quite a fun game for getting the hang of it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://flexboxfroggy.com/&quot;&gt;Flexbox Froggy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, it seems very oriented to kids, but I found it quite creative. For some more detailed information on the topic, you can&apos;t go wrong with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/&quot;&gt;CSS Tricks Guide to Flexbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I have been revisting the topic is because Flexbox is the way that React Native powers layouts. While the CSS Tricks guide has been a goto resource for years, I had never encountered Flexbox Froggy before. Worth a few minutes of diversion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, since Flexbox is the default for React Native and as a result is attuned to mobile/vertical phone layouts, there are a few differences to regular web-based Flexbox defaults: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column;
box-sizing: border-box;
position: relative;
align-items: stretch;
flex-shrink: 0;
align-content: flex-start;
border: 0 solid black;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
min-width: 0;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And dimensions in React Native are unitless. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[React Developer Roadmap: Part 2.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Build Tools and Package Managers. When it comes to Package Managers, I doubt you would get very far in the modern JavaScript world without…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0130/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0130/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Build Tools and Package Managers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Package Managers, I doubt you would get very far in the modern JavaScript world without getting to know NPM or Yarn, so to me, the more you code, the more familiar you will get with these tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Build Tools, fortunately, as far as I know, the major frameworks tend to have their own CLIs which take care of most of the basics required to get up and running. As a result, getting started, I would not fret too much about learning Webpack and the rest. What you do need to keep in mind, is that, mostly, it is Webpack that sits underneath Create React App, the Angular CLI and so forth. As such, learning Webpack is definitely valuable if you need to make customisations to your build tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;State Management.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have only recently started learning Redux, and have no experience with MobX so I don&apos;t have much to add here. Redux seems to have proliferated very deeply and widely across the React ecosystem so even though Hooks provides alternatives, chances are good that many existing React applications are still running with Redux. As such, it is very important to learn it. That being said, it is better to learn to manage React&apos;s component state before diving into Redux. As Dan Abramov himself has said, Redux is not the solution for everything. It is a tool like any other and should be used as such. Decisions on how to manage state need to be made on a project specific basis. My feeling is you should only move on to Redux once you are fairly comfortable working with React&apos;s own state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, it is also important to learn about localStorage on the browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Not mentioned on this Roadmap since I believe it only came after it was published, but Hooks seems to be the next big thing in React state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forms.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to React and forms, my current experience is to manage forms via local component state and controlled components. From what I have seen Redux Form is not advisable with the developer himself putting up a notice regarding its shortcomings. I have not used Formik or any of the others, but my feeling is that good ol&apos; controlled components will get you quite far. That being said, Redux Form and Formik are on my React to-do list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;API Clients.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to API clients mentioned here, these are applicable across all of JavaScript. Axios is widely used in Node.js and SuperAgent tends to be popular in the world of testing. I would venture to say that fetch support might still be a question mark when it comes to browser support on the front-end. From what I have seen, Axios is by far the preferred tool for React and Node.js. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GraphQL.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have used GraphQL on this very site and have done some basic tutorials on it, I am still far more familiar and comfortable with the REST approach. Once I have completed my React/React Native learning spree, chances are good I will turn to GraphQL on both the server and client to improve my understanding and use of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Routing.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, react-router is more or less the de-facto router for React. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Utility Libraries.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to see these included here. Lodash is fantastic. As is Moment for working with dates and times. RxJS is heavily used in the Angular world, though I have not seen much of it in React so far. I am not familiar with the others mentioned thus far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, when it comes to React testing you need to focus on the following: Jest, Enzyme or React Testing Library and Cypress. Those will get you very far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;i18n and a11y.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam does not include a11y in his list, but I believe it should have a place here. I myself have limited experience with a11y but it is something I need to invest on in the future. Having work on various multi-lingual projects in my career, I have done quite a lot of work with i18n, however, none in React so far. As such, I will definitely be going with Adam&apos;s recommendations here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mobile.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently learning React Native and the applicability of React to React Native was one of the large attractions of React for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Rest.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gatsby is great! It is growing rapidly in popularity and is great to work with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have heard good things about Next.js, and I intend to delve into it in future, but it is not a high priority for me at this very moment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would not bother with the &quot;Backend Integration&quot; section unless you work in Ruby. I don&apos;t know what similar tools are available for Node.js or other languages and am not sure why it has been listed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know next to nothing about the rest of the items so will not comment on any of them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best for your learning journey!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[React Developer Roadmap: Part 1.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I came across  Adam Golab's "React Developer Roadmap"  some time ago, however, having spent the past few weeks deep-diving into React, I…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0129/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0129/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adam-golab/react-developer-roadmap&quot;&gt;Adam Golab&apos;s &quot;React Developer Roadmap&quot;&lt;/a&gt; some time ago, however, having spent the past few weeks deep-diving into React, I wanted to take another look at it from the perspective of my own experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn the Basics.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam&apos;s roadmap rightfully starts out with the basics. Having a solid understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript on their own is essential. I would however, put an asterisk on the &quot;JS Basics&quot;. While you certainly need to know the basics, the &quot;Basics&quot; listed cover enormous parts of the JavaScript landscape and factor into some of the React specific elements later in the roadmap.  My feeling is that JavaScript needs its own section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;JavaScript.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my career has progressed, JavaScript has been an area of increasing focus for me. Becoming better at JavaScript should be a continual and ongoing process. While I understand exactly what Adam means by &quot;basics&quot; the reality is that, the concepts listed there will come in handy at any and every level of your programming journey. No matter how long you have been at it, I am convinced that there will always be something new to learn or to review with JavaScript (especially since it evolves at such breakneck speed). Considering how widely used JavaScript is, investing into improving your core JavaScript skills is something to focus on in an ongoing capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CSS.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started learning HTML and CSS, CSS-based layouts with floats were becoming the norm as people moved away from &quot;table-based&quot; layout. For many years, that was more or less the standard required. With the emergence of CSS3 and later CSS pre-processors along the ever increasing improtance of responsive layouts catering to mobile devices - the importance and challenge of CSS increased. To my mind, CSS is at times easy to dismiss as a &quot;lesser&quot; skill than JavaScript, but don&apos;t be so quick to judge. CSS is surprisingly hard to master. Combine CSS with multiple, ever changing device sizes and multiple ever changing browser capabilities and you have the ingredients for some incredibly messy and confusing CSS code if you are not careful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience many developers will claim to &quot;know&quot; CSS and then proceed to write poor CSS. CSS is deceptively simple at a glance, but surprisingly tricky to get right. With the proliferation of CSS-in-JS libraries in the React world, my feeling is that it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important to spend a solid amount of time coming to grips with CSS. Now that there are at least 3 major layout approaches available: floats, flexbox and grid it is necessary to have a grip on them. Not to mention the two large camps of pre-processors in SASS and Less. Not to mention the CSS-in-JS crowd or the ever increasing number of CSS frameworks and design systems finding their way into the mainstream. Just a few years ago, Bootstrap, and to a lesser extent, Foundation, became massively popular. Since then, an ever increasing variety of frameworks have emerged - most of which are listed in Adam&apos;s Roadmap. The trick here, however, is to focus on knowing the CSS basics &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well. Regardless of the &quot;framework&quot;, the core CSS knowledge is the most important to learn because, when it comes down to it, the frameworks are all just manifestations of CSS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same should also be said for JavaScript - while frameworks may come and go. You are far better off investing first in learning the language and then in the framework. Knowing JavaScript will help you to learn React, Angular or Vue, but only knowing &quot;Angular&quot; will only get you so far in respects to the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;General Development Skills.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the section &quot;General Development Skills&quot;, my feeling is that there needs to be some separation here. I understand why these skills are listed together, but my feeling is that &quot;Data Structures and Algorithms&quot; and &quot;Design Patterns&quot; should be more closely linked to a possible &quot;Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript&quot; section. Creating another JavaScript-related area would emphasise just how important JavaScript is to the entire roadmap. Especially since, out of the major frameworks (React, Angular and Vue) React tends to be more JavaScript-y than the others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, &quot;Data Structures and Algorithms&quot; and &quot;Design Patterns&quot; are also segments that are not JavaScript specific. The way they are applied to JavaScript might be more or less unique, but the concepts, patterns and algorithms will be knowledge that can be applied broadly to more languages. So maybe, there is something to be said about &quot;meta&quot; skills on the roadmap. Some are unique to JavaScript or React, but really, there is a lot going on underneath the covers that relates more broadly to programming and problem solving at large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to &quot;Terminal usage&quot;, my feeling is that, in a sense, this is a skill that comes hand-in-hand with working with Git, npm and the various CLIs that are so popular these days. Anyone working with Git, npm and any form of CLI is going to become far more familiar with the terminal than they would otherwise. In my own experience, I started learning terminal when I started to use Gulp. Granted, some people may prefer to use GUIs that sit on top of Git, either through the VS Code or IntelliJ (or similar) IDEs or some other means. My advice, however to new developers would be to put in the effort and try to learn and use the terminal before relying on the GUIs. Once you have a decent grasp of it, move over to GUI tools if you choose. The reality is that, the command line, is effectively the &apos;real&apos; lingua franca of the computer world. Before touch, before the mouse and the GUI there was the terminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HTTP/HTTPS Protocols and API Clients.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that the best way to learn HTTP/HTTPS and API clients is to work with API based projects. You will learn a lot just from inspecting the XHR tab on the Network panel of your browser developer tools. From there you can start building Postman or Insomnia collections. (Or better yet, if you really want to show-off your terminal skills, start using cURL). Nothing will teach you more about HTTP/HTTPS/APIs than working with directly with APIs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, one can take a swing at learning to build your own APIs. Now, this might not really fit in nicely with a &quot;React&quot; roadmap per-se, but for me, the best thing I did for my JavaScript skills was to learn Node.js and start building my own APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Full-stack...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be the first to admit that the term &quot;full-stack&quot; seems to be overused and misunderstood. In my experience, the larger an organisation or a team gets, the smaller the focus of a particular developer will tend to become. By their very nature, small teams will benefit from less people doing &quot;more&quot;. Whereas larger teams tend to gain efficiency by &quot;more&quot; people doing &quot;less&quot;. Not less in terms of productivity, but less in terms of the overall scope of their work. As such, unless you are working as an independent developer or a developer in a small team, chances are good that you are inherently focusing more on one part of the stack than another. The reason I bring up this topic however is because, by learning Node.js, and in relation, how to build APIs, you are essentially investing into improving your overall JavaScript skills in a big way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it comes down to how I tend to learn things, but I really felt that my JavaScript knowledge improved immensely once I dug into Node.js. Building APIs and learning about the nature of backend development opened so many doors and lifted so many perceived limitations from my programming mindset. Learning Node.js helped me realise that I could be a &quot;real&quot; programmer despite my &quot;front-end only&quot; background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn to search for solutions.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for and finding solutions is definitely a skill. As is recognising when and how to learn from, absorb and apply the solutions you find. Something I would add, or rather preface &quot;searching&quot; with are two slightly more fundamental skills: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; code. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; error messages. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that one of the greatest breakthroughs in my programming life came about when I realised that I could improve my &lt;em&gt;comprehension&lt;/em&gt; of code and of error messages just by reading code. In a way, when you start out, error messages are a terrible thing. They feel like blame or punishment. They are often in the colour red, and they are written in weird, hard to understand language. To the beginner, they often leave you confused and demotivated. The more you read code and error messages, the more you will begin to ask yourself questions about what you are reading and the more helpful they will become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you read code or an error message, don&apos;t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; read it. After each line, ask yourself: &quot;What does this code (or error message) mean? What is it telling me if I were to translate it into plain language?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something immensely useful in this process is &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubberduckdebugging.com/&quot;&gt;&quot;Rubber Duck Debugging (RDD)&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Especially if you are a remote or independent developer, taking this approach will do wonders for your ability to solve problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I often try to remember when facing a bug is to acknowledge two things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thing I am &lt;em&gt;assuming&lt;/em&gt; is happening is not happening. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means that somewhere along the line something I wrote is not doing what I think it is doing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, via process of elimination you start stepping through your code to verify whether what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is happening, is actually happening. Chances are good you will soon find the source of your bug. &lt;/p&gt;

The past few weeks have been tricky for me, I have had some problems with lower back pain which has kept my activity levels to the lowest they have been all year. It has been frustrating, and while my focus on learning new things on the programming side, the lack of physical activity has not been great. Since I have had some back issues in the past, I did not want to rush recovery and it has made me careful about getting back on the water. Today felt good though, I rode the new feature in the park a few times, landing it was a real boost of confidence. During last week&apos;s ride I also landed a trick I only learnt on the last day of last season which was also a high for me. While I am not yet back to where I was last season, all things considered, I think things are off to a decent start!  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lodash.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I really like Lodash.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following will grab the an input, enter the text &quot;my text goes here&quot; into the input and then check whether the input&apos;s value prop is set to the same text: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cy.get(&quot;input&quot;)
.type(&quot;my text goes here&quot;)
.should(&quot;have.value&quot;, &quot;my text goes here&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following will get the input with the attribute &quot;placeholder&quot; and check for the text &quot;Search&quot;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cy.get(&quot;input&quot;)
.invoke(&quot;attr&quot;, &quot;placholder&quot;)
.should(&quot;contain&quot;, &quot;Search&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will get the first anchor tag on the page, click on it and then check that the url it navigates to containts &quot;/yoururl&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cy.get(&quot;a&quot;)
.first()
.click()
.url()
.should(&quot;include&quot;, &quot;/yoururl&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following grabs the h1 tag and checks for the text &quot;My heading&quot; within it:
&lt;code&gt;cy.get(&quot;h1&quot;).contains(&quot;My heading&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following grabs the div with the classname &quot;your-special-classname&quot; and checks for the text &quot;Your spectial text...&quot; within it:
&lt;code&gt;cy.get(&quot;div.your-special-classname&quot;).contains(&quot;Your spectial text...&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will find the 2nd select element and &quot;select&quot; the option with the text &quot;Option 3&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cy.get(&quot;select&quot;)
.eq(1)
.select(&quot;Option 3&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Cypress.io is a JavaScript-based library for writing end-to-end (e2e) tests. As their website says: &quot;Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience of using Cypress bears that statement out so far. Being a newcomer to the library, I was able to write a fairly comprehensive set of e2e tests in an afternoon. As the website lays out, Cypress has 2 focus areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test runner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dashboard service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My usage so far has only covered the &quot;Test runner&quot; which is broken up into two basic parts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup tests (run tests)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write tests &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, getting started is quick and easy. There are no dependencies and you are ready-to-go with the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i --save-dev cypress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your package.json, under &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; add (I have shortened my command for ease-of-typing): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;cy&quot;: &quot;cypress open&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your terminal you can then run: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run cy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will start up the test runner which opens up a browser window with the Cypress interface. From this interface you can then select which tests you want to run or whether you want to run all tests. This, in turn, will open the test browser that will run all the tests. In this window, you have a UI with your tests steps on the left and the actual site/app view on the write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, I am a novice when it comes to e2e testing, but I got a real kick out of seeing my tests run and interact with my app in real-time as the test steps on the left passed or failed. It really is like watching a screen-recording of someone test your app in high-speed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing tests.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as writing tests goes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write you tests in JavaScript in a style that is recognisable across many JS testing libraries. (You have your &apos;describe&apos; and &apos;it&apos; blocks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The API is very similar to jQuery in terms of selecting DOM elements and manipulating them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience so far, Cypress &quot;just works&quot;. Since you are &quot;interacting&quot; with the DOM in a way that the &quot;user&quot; would, you are basically replicating, in declarative-style code, how someone would use your app, and what they will expect to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, I find it a lot simpler and intuitive to write Cypress tests than unit/integration tests. At my first outing, I was writing my e2e tests after the fact. Now, my experience with unit testing had me nervous about this scenario because, typically, writing tests &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you have already implemented your app means you can look forward to a lot of refactoring to get the test working smoothly. Since Cypress is &apos;looking&apos; at your app as a whole, as the user, it is not concerned with all the implementation details, just with the what is on the screen and what happens as a result of interactions. The details of interaction still need to be tested by your unit/integration tests though - Cypress does not replace the need for those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparing my first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree, I felt it was a good opportunity to expand my skillset. I have heard a few things about Cypress lately, and wanted to try it out on a small example app. This project was the perfect opportunity and I would encourage anyone out there to give it a try. Chances are you will be pleasantly surprised! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Redux Impressions.]]></title><description><![CDATA[As part of the Udacity React Nanodegree course, the section on Redux has students building a basic implementation of Redux.

The app is a small &quot;Todos&quot; app with our own rudimentary implementation of Redux (matching the basis API) with the UI written in plain JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, our rudimentary &quot;Redux&quot; implementation is supplemented with a very basic example of middleware. This implementation is ultimately replaced by Redux itself with Redux middleware added. Based on the fact that our DIY version of Redux matched the Redux API, switching over was very straightfoward. Thereafter, the UI is re-written into React, with both the vanilla JS UI and the React UI present on the page at once. Redoing the UI in React and plugging in the existing state implementation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progression of this tutorial was ingenius in that it revealed, very practically the following things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The building blocks and principles of Redux. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illustrated the use of the Redux building blocks and how they come together. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The usefulness and flexibility that having state separate from UI provides. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gone through the example, I was blown away by how easily the refactored React UI was able to &quot;plug into&quot; the existing Redux state management. Granted, the premise of the app is very simple, so there will likely be more complexity with a more complex app, but my intial impressions are positive. Overall, my feeling of how Tyler and the team represented Redux did a lot to &quot;demystify&quot; it to me. I feel, more so than before, have a decent grasp on the concepts and I look forward to using Redux and learning more about it in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

As I understand it, Redux, in short is a &lt;em&gt;predictable state container&lt;/em&gt; for JavaScript apps with the primary goal being to improve the predictability of state in an application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of mixing application state in amongst UI code all over the app, Redux stores all data in once location. This data store is a state tree. Essentially one JavaScript object outside of the UI. The UI will then reference the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 elements in Redux: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening for changes to the state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating the state. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These functionalities are distributed amongst the following (simplified example): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store = state (+ the function of the store)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the state = getState function. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening for changes to the state = subscribe function. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating the state = dispatch function. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actions.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions are events that trigger changes to state. They are javascript objects with a &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; type property and an &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; payload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actions Creators.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action creators are functions that create/return action objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reducers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducers are functions that take in state and actions and return new (not-mutated) state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Store.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The store returns the store object. createStore must be passed a reducer with which to operate on the store. The store itself has three methods: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getState()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subscribe()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dispatch()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods have access to the state of the store via closure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a rudimentary example of a &quot;Redux&quot; store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// library code
function createStore(reducer) {
  let state;
  let listeners = [];

  const getState = () =&gt; state;

  const subscribe = listener =&gt; {
    listeners.push(listener);
    return () =&gt; {
      listeners = listeners.filter(l =&gt; l !== listener);
    };
  };

  const dispatch = action =&gt; {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    listeners.forEach(listener =&gt; listener()); // invoke all the listeners
  };

  return {
    getState,
    subscribe,
    dispatch
  };
}

// app code: dev writes reducer function
function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case &quot;ADD_TODO&quot;:
      return state.concat([action.todo]); // is pure since concat returns a new array not a mutated array.
    case &quot;REMOVE_TODO&quot;:
      return state.filter(todo =&gt; todo.id !== action.id);
    case &quot;TOGGLE_TODO&quot;:
      return state.map(todo =&gt;
        todo.id !== action.id ? todo : Object.assign({}, todo, { complete: !todo.complete })
      );
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const store = createStore(todos);

store.subscribe(() =&gt; {
  console.log(&quot;Update state: &quot;, store.getState());
});

store.dispatch({
  type: &quot;ADD_TODO&quot;,
  todo: {
    id: 1,
    name: &quot;Learn Redux&quot;,
    complete: false
  }
});

// const unsubscibe = store.subscribe(() =&gt; {
//   console.log(&quot;Update state again: &quot;, store.getState());
// });

// unsubscribe();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Decisions/Trade-Offs.]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Udacity React Nanodegree's first project is a simple application called "My Reads".

Effectively, the app involves you adding and moving books between &quot;bookshelves/lists&quot; based on whether you: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Want to read&quot; the book. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are &quot;Currently Reading&quot; a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have &quot;Read&quot; a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is simple enough, but it illustrates an important aspect of web development which is &quot;deciding on state&quot; aka. How are you going to organise and manage data/state in your application? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I approached this project was to considering the following: At minimum there is the relationship between the units (&quot;Books&quot; in this case) and the collections (&quot;Bookshelves&quot; or categories). There are many books, and many bookshelves, but a particular book can only be on one bookshelf at a time. As a result, the decision on how to structure/manage the state is premised on how one decides to model the relationship(s). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, to my thinking, I decided that my app&apos;s primary collection would be &quot;Shelves&quot;. Which meant that books were added to or removed from a shelf. Much like physical bookshelves in a room. You take a book and you put it on a shelf. If you want to move it, you take it off the shelf and put it on another. I would say it is the obvious analogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing to consider here is that even this simple premise reveals the concept of trade-offs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider for a moment, that an alternate approach to this question would be that you have &quot;books&quot; as your base collection. Essentially you only have a list of books and then each book has a field that determines which shelf it belongs to. In this approach, you have no &quot;shelves&quot; per se. Only books. This approach has the benefit of making it relatively simple to determine which shelf a book belongs to anywhere in the application since the information is right there with the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One trade-off here, however, is that the &quot;shelf&quot; does not really have anything to do with the book itself. As a result, if you are then asked &quot;Which books are on shelf x?&quot;, in order to answer this question, you would need to iterate through &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the books in order to determine/assign the books to the necessary shelf. This might be considered onerous the larger the collection of books becomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the former approach however, i.e. having shelves as the base collection. One gets to keep the book&apos;s data &quot;pure&quot; in the sense that you do not mix shelf data in with the book data. This has the benefit of being able to easily determine which books are in a shelf by looking only at the shelf and not bothering with any other books not on that shelf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-off however, is that, you need to do extra work to be able to determine which shelf a book is on when looking at the &quot;only&quot; the book. In this case, the latter solution would be more convenient since you would be able to know which particular shelf a book belongs to quite easily. The problem comes when someone wants to know about the shelf, or how many shelves there are... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is a simple example and the repercussions of such a decision within such a small app are likely very small, my feeling is that, even this simple example illustrates at least two possible paths and their associated trade-offs to be considered. This is an important lesson and design concept to keep in mind because with each extra feature an application has, these decisions and trade-offs come into focus and over time, their associated strengths and weaknesses will become more pravalent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the lessons to keep learning about software, is that, while you certainly get right/wrong decisions at times, most often it is more a case of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of an approach. The better you are able to make the cases for and against any particular course of action, and to dig into the possible strengths and weaknesses, the better equipped you will be to solve the problem and improve your solution over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Udacity Git Commit Message Styleguide.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I completed the first course's materials in the Udacity React Nanodegree program today.

After spending the first few sections getting up to speed with the basics, the content today covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start&quot;&gt;React Router&lt;/a&gt;, paticularly, react-router-dom. To finalise this section of the course, there is a practical course project to consolidate the course content so far. As part of the requirements, Udacity has styelguides to adhere to when coding for this. Here they are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I found the Git commit styleguide of interest since, to date, I have not worked on a project with a Git-specific guideline. Granted, I have worked on projects with guidelines on repo-usage, but we did not have such detailed instructions. I think I will make use of these in future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feat: a new feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix: a bug fix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;docs: changes to documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refactor: refactoring production code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day#1: Basics.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day One mostly covered the basics, kicking off with an emphasis on four points of React: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Composition.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively this means taking simple functions and combining them into more complex functions. This is the bedrock of React and is reflected in the focus on components. React applications are more or less just one complex component made up of very many simpler components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Focus on Declarative vs Imperative Coding.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperative means to command, i.e. detailing every step of what needs to be done.
Declarative means to declare what you want and the React or JS handles how exactly to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, in React, you declare &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;markup&lt;/code&gt; and React handles the imperative work of keeping the DOM in sync with your app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. One-way data flow.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React emphasises one-way data flow. Essentially this means that you maintain or mutate state in parent components and pass data down, via props to the child components. If a child component is responsible for triggering a state change, the handler that mutates state in the parent is passed down, via props to the child which will then call that handler so that the parent can mutate the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. React is just JavaScript.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I already have a sense for, but React, ultimately is only a view, and fundamentally is very JavaScript-y. You use .map to iterate over collections in order to display items. Unlike Angular which makes use og ngFor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rendering UI with React.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of rending string templates, React uses JavaScript objects to describe and build UI. React elements describe DOM nodes. React uses a Virtual DOM, the render() method is what takes that description and renders actual DOM nodes to the browser. This is why it is so important to keep the concept of state in mind with React. React is very good at rendering, as long as it knows what is in state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cornerstone of React is components. A key to working in React is to &quot;think in components&quot;. Essentially, all UIs are just collections of components. Another phrase to keep in mind is to &quot;favour composition over inheritance&quot;. Components &lt;em&gt;extend&lt;/em&gt; React.Component, but it is only extended once. Instead of extending components, we compose components together via nesting and passing props. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day#2.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day Two kicked off with State Management. The golden rule to remember here is that components have &quot;state&quot; and when state changes, React re-renders the component (and all children). This is why it is critical to manage and set state correctly. This is done by using setState. setState will then trigger the re-renders. You never mutate state directly, what you do in fact, is create copy of the mutatated data and then setState will manage the update since it keeps track of all state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else to keep in mind here is the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state is for data that changes over time. i.e. mutable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;props are for data that is passed down and DOES not change. i.e. immutable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Class Components and Functional Stateless Components.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this early stage, there are two options when it comes to constructing your components: Class-based Components and so-called Stateless Functional Components. Essentially, if your component is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; responsible for rendering UI and changes no state, it can be a functional component. If your component needs to manage state, it will be class-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Questions to ask oneself when working with React: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which state do I have in my app? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the UI changes based off of that state? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes: &quot;Your UI is just a function of your state&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: Do NOT initialise state with props! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; State will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be initialised with props when the component is first created. As such, if the props change (as a result of state change higher up the chain), the component will not know about it. This anti-pattern is a deviation from the concept of &quot;single source of truth&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember:&lt;/strong&gt; The magic of React is that, when state changes it automatically re-renders the component tree. As such, doing things &quot;out of state&quot;, that should be &quot;in state&quot;, is going to give you headaches at some point or other.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Udacity React Nanodegree.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I took the leap and signed-up to the  React Nanodegree  course on  Udacity .

&lt;p&gt;At the same time I pledged to take up the &lt;code&gt;#30DaysOfUdacity&lt;/code&gt; challenge which has me committing to do at least 30 minutes of Udacity course work a day for the following 30 days. My journey into React has been brewing for some time now and today marks a significant stepping stone on that journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;React so far...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have significant experience in web development broadly, and AngularJs in more recent times, I have, as of writing this, no production React experience. This means that while I have confidence I will, in time, learn React and become increasingly comfortable and fluent in it, I do have a desire to &lt;em&gt;accelerate&lt;/em&gt; my path towards confident competence. As a result, to date, I have been working through a few courses to help me along my way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namely, I have completed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react&quot;&gt;&quot;Mastering React&quot;&lt;/a&gt; course by Mosh Hamedani (highly recommended as an introduction to the basics - without Redux). From there, I am currently busy with two Udemy courses by Stephen Grider: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/&quot;&gt;&quot;Modern React with Redux (2019 Update)&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/&quot;&gt;&quot;The Complete React Native + Hooks Course (2019 Edition)&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both have so far been very good. From those courses alone, I have fairly rapidly built up a base-level competence in understanding and working with React. As a (currently) solo developer though, the thing that is missing in the above courses however is feedback. Particularly, expert feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Udacity?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite similar names, Udemy and Udacity represent approaches on opposite sides of the &quot;online learning&quot; spectrum: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Udemy.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/&quot;&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; offers anything and everything taught by anyone at very low prices. If there is something you want to learn, chances are Udemy has course by someone available. The trade-off however is that the quality and satisfaction that results may vary wildly. In the end though, chances are you may not worry too much about it one way or the other because the courses are low-price. (At least during the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; frequent Udemy sales). The trick with Udemy is to find instructors you like and stick them. In my case, these have been: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/?key=taught_courses&amp;#x26;taught_courses=1&quot;&gt;Stephen Grider&lt;/a&gt; (in-depth, mostly React and related ecosystems).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/&quot;&gt;Maximillian Schwarzmuller&lt;/a&gt; (slightly less depth, but wider variety of topics covering Angular, Vue and React amongst others).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/user/reed-barger/&quot;&gt;Reed Barger&lt;/a&gt; for a variety of &quot;trendy tech&quot; code-alongs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Udemy offers you all you could learn, and with the right instructors, very good value for money. The thing is, you are left pretty much to your own devices. As a result, you will learn quickly, and depending on what you do with the knowledge, you may or may not end up actually using what you have learnt. Even more so, you don&apos;t have much support or feedback on what you do. So, while the content you are taught is of a good quality, where that translates into any quality on your side is debateable. This is precisely where Udacity steps in... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Udacity.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/&quot;&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt; is the Apple to Udemy&apos;s Android. Udacity is on the high-end. The courses are, relative to Udemy, expensive. While I cannot yet comment on the quality, the difference Udacity offers is in personalised service. Content and course quality aside, what Udacity offers is a much more &quot;holistic&quot; approach to your learning experience with a heavy emphasis on: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:1 Mentorship - courses offer once-weekly Zoom calls with course mentors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback - this involves code and project reviews along with reviews covering your resume, cover letters, GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile amongst others. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career Counselling - as part of your course you get one meeting with a career counsellor in which you get feedback on your overall career situation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career Services - following your graduation, you have available to you a variety of &quot;Career Services&quot; which include things like access to a pool or Udacity-specific recruiters and companies looking to hire Udacity graduates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all of this is well and good. The thing that interested me however, was the feedback and to a slightly lesser extent, the mentorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honest, constructive and useful feedback is critical to the learning experience and to getting better. If you do not get feedback on your work, how do you know whether what you are doing is up to scratch? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, you don&apos;t. The consequence of this is that, while I have many years experience working in my field, a question I often have is just how do I stack up against those working in places like Silicon Valley? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that, for better or worse, Silicon Valley is the hub of the technology world. The expectation is that the level of quality and performance in programming there is of the highest level. Regardless of whether that is true or not (I know there are high/higher quality developers the world over), the question of how one&apos;s skills compare lingers. As a result, since Udacity is US-based, with ties to the Googles and Ubers of the world, my feeling was that enrolling for a course at Udacity, would, if nothing else, give me feedback through &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; eyes. As such, while moving to Silicon Valley would be quite a costly experience to get that kind of feedback, maybe getting code-reviewed and mentored by those in Silicon Valley might provide a light facsimile of the experience remotely! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[WordPress + AirPress.]]></title><description><![CDATA[With my recent dive into Airtable, I have been looking into options for using Airtable data for a potential use case.

First off, Airtable has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/api&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; and a first-party &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/airtable&quot;&gt;npm package&lt;/a&gt; that can be used via Node.js. This makes it really easy to setup a basic Node.js API through which to access data. The thing is, the use case involves WordPress so after looking into the API access topic, I considered whether it might be make more sense to the client to use a WordPress plugin since they already have an existing WordPress website and site maintainer. As such, my thinking is that if I were to stick with the tools they already use and are comfortable, it would make the ongoing maintenance of the site and data easier. Additionally, I would not need to setup a separate Node.js API for a single use-case type of purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick Google search lead me to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/airpress/&quot;&gt;AirPress&lt;/a&gt; plugin by Chester McLaughlin. Helpfully Chester provides a few YouTube videos to get you quickly up to speed on the basics. Straight off the bat, my feeling is that this is not a particularly &quot;user friendly&quot; plugin. What I mean by that is, this is a plugin for a WordPress site-builder or WordPress developer to use in their toolbelt. In order to understand how this plugin works you will need to have some grasp of basic development concepts, shortcodes, Airtable formulas and Regex. For the &quot;casual&quot; user, this plugin might be a little tricky to parse. That being said, if you are comfortable with WordPress parlance, you should find it relatively painless to setup and get going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, if you are not inclined to watch those videos, here is a quick reference for how to setup the shortcodes in your template page in order to display multiple records in one WordPress page (I suggest you edit your shortcode in &quot;Code Editor&quot; view if you are comfortable with it):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[apr_populate field=&quot;id&quot; relatedTo=&quot;id&quot;]
    [apr_loop]
        &amp;#x3C;div class=&quot;items&quot;&gt;Dates: [apr field=&quot;WeekRange&quot;]
        Code: [apr field=&quot;WeekCode&quot;]&amp;#x3C;/div&gt;
    [/apr_loop]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;field=&quot;id&quot; means the primary key or primary identifying field for the records in your table. You use that same field in the &lt;code&gt;relatedTo&lt;/code&gt; field if you are not referencing other tables. This is a very useful field if you are displaying fields that reference data in other tables since then you can use the value in &lt;code&gt;relatedTo&lt;/code&gt; in order to make use of that data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;[apr_loop]&lt;/code&gt; is a AirPress/shortcode-y way of looping through all the records you want to display. i.e. A for loop. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the &apos;loop&apos; you can now access the values within the single records via [apr field=&quot;column-name-goes-here&quot;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you can see, you can also add in typical HTML code in order to hook your CSS styling into. &lt;/li&gt;

My interest has been re-kindled for the following reasons: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considering the ever-increasing power of the large social-media giants and their related controversies, I feel that the WordPress mission of democratizing publishing on the web is more important than ever. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to find a way to contribute back to a community that learned so much from and have benefitted from in my own life. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After several years working in the JavaScript and REST API world, the emergence of the WP REST API shines a new light on possibilities of using WordPress in new ways. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since using Gatsby and GraphQL for my &apos;Today I Leared&apos; GitHub page, I am intrigued by the WP GraphQL plugin. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My recent dive into using Glide to build mobile apps has got me thinking of ways to incorporate WordPress content into Glide workflows so that people using WordPress can find new ways to present their content to their customers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[React Reasoning.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I started experimenting with React earlier this year and then a few weeks ago, decided to really dig into the topic.

I was interested in the framework from a few perspectives: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having worked in the &quot;AngularJs/Angular&quot; world for several years, I was curious about how React would be to use in a real project. i.e. Not reading other people&apos;s viewpoints on it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anecdotally, it seems to me that most job openings internationally, especially in the US and Silicon Valley seem to be React-leaning. I don&apos;t have any data to back this up, but when looking at companies that could comprise a wishlist of companies to work for, they all seemed to be in favour of React. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With my burgeoning interest in mobile development, the realtionship between React and React Native and how those skills might cross-pollinate made for an attractive topic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From my basic introductions to React, my feeling is that React somehow feels more JavaScript-&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; somehow. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &quot;Typescript&quot; factor seems to me moving into the React world in a real way, and I am curious whether my experience working with TypeScript in Angular and Nest.js will make a transition to React easier for me, or harder. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mix 'n Match.]]></title><description><![CDATA[While I have not been posting regularly of late, a lot has been going on.

It has been a real rush of mixing and matching ideas, services and learning new things!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Glide.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back I started experimenting with the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glideapps.com&quot;&gt;Glide&lt;/a&gt;. I have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.chat/users/nicholas-preto&quot;&gt;contributing&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.chat/glideapps&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; where I can by answering questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey into Glide introduced me to the world of Google Sheets. While I was familiar with Google Sheets and had a surface level of knowledge in terms of formulas, my Glide work really pushed me to dig deeper. This process resulted in me starting to learn a lot more about formulas, as well as to experiment with both Google App Script and Airtable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google App Script.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Google App Script is essentially JavaScript. From what I can tell, it is more like JavaScript from several years ago! Out of the box, there is no support for modern ES features and the IDE environment leaves a lot to be desired. This lead me to looking for alternative options in order to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: Develop locally in a more familiar and comfortable environment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B: Develop with more modern language features. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My search quickly lead me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/clasp&quot;&gt;Clasp&lt;/a&gt; (Command-Line App Script Project). This library attracted me because it was command-line based and seems, on the surface, to be very similar to something like npm or the Heroku CLI. Furthermore, Clasp enables you to use TypeScript, which has modern ES language feagtures built-in. Since I am familiar with TypeScript form working with Angular, I was very happy with this! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Airtable.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt; is pitched as a combination of a Spreadsheet and a Database, but with a much friendler, consumer-friendly face. Admittedly, my first hour using the application was frustrating since I carried over many of my expectations from Google Sheets. After butting my head against the UI for a while, I decided to take a step back and reset. This meant forgetting all expectations I had from the Google Sheets world, and looking at Airtable with fresh eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like about Airtable, is that it comes with an API and Node.js client out of the box! This means, you can integrate Airtable into an app straight away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Airtable Plus.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a very brief initiation to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/api&quot;&gt;Airtable API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/airtable/airtable.js/tree/master&quot;&gt;Node.js client&lt;/a&gt; (which is promise based), I decided to dive straight in and use it for an app idea I have been thinking about. In recent time, working with Node.js and React has had me using async/await extensively and as a result, I was looking to use this approach for my app. Fortunately, there is a npm module called &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable-plus.js.org/&quot;&gt;Airtable Plus&lt;/a&gt; which present the Airtable API in a async/await-friendly manner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;React &amp;#x26; React Native.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have dipped my toe into React before, I have not jumped into the framework in a real project before. This has now changed. I have spent the past few weeks coming to grips with it and have no begun working on some real code. At the same time, I am learning React Native. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking all the above into consideration, things have been quite busy! While any one of the above topics are interesting on their own, effectively taking them all in simultaneously has been quite a ride! None the less, I am inspired by what I have already learned and beyond excited for what is still to come! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Ways to Reverse a String.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Using .reverse() Using .reduce() Using for... of Using a for() loop Using a while() loop Tests.]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0113/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0113/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Using .reverse()&lt;/h3&gt;

My usage has not been very deep. Mostly just making lists of things I like to keep track of. However, with the discovery of the wonderful app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glideapps.com/&quot;&gt;Glide&lt;/a&gt;, my usage of Google Sheets has increased dramatically! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Filter.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filter is a very useful formula enabling you to &lt;em&gt;filter&lt;/em&gt; your view of data. For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=filter(SheetName!A:E,Sheet!E:E=TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will pull data in from columns A to E in SheetName and will then display all items that have a value of TRUE in Column E of that same sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Unique.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unique enables you to pull out &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; values from a list of values. For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=UNIQUE(SheetName!I2:I)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will pull all unique values in from SheetName Column I from rows 2 to as many rows as I contains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sort.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sort lets you, well, &lt;em&gt;sort&lt;/em&gt; data in your sheet. I tend to use it to sort data from another sheet. For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=SORT(SheetName!A2:F, 4, true)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will sort data from SheetName in the range of Columns A to F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;IF.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If lets you specify a condition, for example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=IF(D2=1,D2 &amp;#x26; &quot; spot available&quot;, D2 &amp;#x26; &quot; spots available&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above will check whether D2 is equal to 1, if so it will print &apos;1 spot available&apos;, else it will print the value in D2 &apos; spots available&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;QUERY.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Query is a very powerful functions, essentially, it enables you to import data from another sheet and then use SQL to query that data. For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=query({Vacancies2019!A2:F;Vacancies2020!A2:F;Vacancies2021!A2:F}, &quot;Select * where Col4&gt;0 or Col5&gt;0 or Col6&gt;0&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above, data from 3 separate sheets is pulled in. From that pool of data, all the information is pulled in where the values in Column 4, 5 or 6 are greater than 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;IMPORTFEED.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093337?hl=en&amp;#x26;ref_topic=9199554&quot;&gt;IMPORTFEED&lt;/a&gt; enables you to pull in RSS feed information into your Google Sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=IMPORTFEED(&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/feed/&quot;,,TRUE,5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will pull in 5 itesm from the official WordPress RSS news feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parameters: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The URL you want to pull in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can specify the query or fields you want to pull in, this is by defaults set to &apos;items&apos; which pulls in the feed line items. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A boolean to say whether you want to pull in headers/headings. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of items you would like to pull in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;IMPORTXML.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093342?hl=en&amp;#x26;ref_topic=9199554&quot;&gt;IMPORTXML&lt;/a&gt; is another very useful function which enables you to pull in data from an XML source (eg. podcast feed) and specify the data you want to retrieve via XPATH queries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=IMPORTXML(&quot;your-rss-feed-here&quot;,&quot;//enclosure/@url&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above will extract the URL property from the &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3C;enclosure&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, thus providing the direct link to the .mp3 file. Notably, this .mp3 file will not be provided via the IMPORTFEED formula, that will just provide the podcast host url for the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is notable that you can actually use IMPORTXML to pull in data from any HTML page and use XPATH to extract data from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about XPATH &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using .nvmrc files to keep track of which Node version I am using in an app. The thing is, the VS Code Terminal does not pick-up on the file and switch the Node version automatically. As a result, I am often need to manually check the file and switch my node version via: &lt;code&gt;nvm use v&amp;#x3C;Version&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed like the perfect opportunity to look into remedying this scenario since it is annoying to run a command only to have it throw errors back at you for using the wrong Node or npm version. A Google search lead me to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-tech-bench/getting-visual-studio-code-and-nvm-working-together-252ec0300895&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll be honest, my eyes started glazing over halfway through. Over the years, my use and appreciation of the terminal has elevated dramatically. The challenge I have is, I still have trouble parsing commands liek this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.nvm/nvm-exec which node | xargs -J % ln -sf % ./.nvm-node &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; chmod +x ./.nvm-node&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exposes the hole in my knowledge of terminal. Improving my knowledge and proficiency of terminal commands has been on my todo list, along with sharpening up my knowledge of Regular Expressions. Unfortunately, despite making improvements, these items tend to slip down my list of priorities in favour of shinier toys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to do it though. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Heroku Commands.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cheat Sheet.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heroku -v // provides you with version info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heroku auth:whoami // displays who you are currently logged in as&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;heroku open // opens the app you are working on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heroku create // creates a new Heroku app and links the Git repo to yours i.e. you do not need to add a remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git remote -v // if you want to check which Git remotes you have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heroku logs // displays the logs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heroku releases -a app-name-here // displays details of the releases of the app on Heroku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heroku status // lets you know if there are any known issues on the platform at present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git push heroku master // will deploy your app from master to Heroku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heroku config:set KEY=value // setup environment variables in Heroku&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faker.js is a really cool utility library for generating, you guessed it! Fake data. This is especially useful when working on prototypes or MVPs before you have real data but don&apos;t want everything to look like it has been cut and pasted from the same place. Simple to use: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add faker&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In index.js: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import faker from &apos;faker&apos;;
...
const name = faker.name.firstName(); // generates a random name
const img = faker.image.avatar(); // generates a fake avatar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really like about the above, is that each time you refresh the page, it gives you fresh new data. Even better is that you no longer need to go and copy/paste lorem ipsum text from your favourite lipsum generator. Faker provides out of the box: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const copy = faker.lorem.sentences(); // generates random lorem ipsum sentence copy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Diffchecker.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long been a fan of Beyond Compare for checking diffs. Granted, I have only used it on Windows machines. Today I came across an online tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diffchecker.com&quot;&gt;Diffchecker&lt;/a&gt; which seems like a great option to use without having to install anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update npm within nvm.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVM is great for managing Node versions on your machine. As one often does, npm gave me a notice that there was a newer version of npm available via npm i -g npm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It suddenly dawned on me, that running this only updated the npm version of my global instance and not the version of npm within my nvm. A quick search revealed that I could use the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm install-latest-npm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will update the version of npm running within your current active Node version inside nvm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;IMPORTFEED.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, Google Sheets makes it very easy to import RSS data (from any RSS feed) using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093337?hl=en&quot;&gt;IMPORTFEED&lt;/a&gt; formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refer to the Google Sheets documentation which says that the format of the IMPORTFEED formula is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMPORTFEED(url, [query], [headers], [num_items])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress RSS.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-hosted WordPress sites, by default, provide an RSS feed at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-feeds/&quot;&gt;/feed URL&lt;/a&gt;. If we were to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/&quot;&gt;official WordPress blog&lt;/a&gt; itself as an example you could find the RSS feed at: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://wordpress.org/news/feed/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the IMPORTFEED documentation, I want to request the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;url will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/feed/&quot;&gt;https://wordpress.org/news/feed/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;query will not be supplied since I am just looking to get the basic feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;headers will be set to TRUE since I want the headers to populated as the title row in the spreadsheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;num_items will be set to 5 since this is an example and I only want to bring in a few items as a test. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, as a test, we can create a &quot;News&quot; tab in our Google Sheet. Then in the first cell add the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=IMPORTFEED(&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/feed/&quot;,,TRUE,5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all is well, you will receive data populated into your Google Sheet! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, you can setup your page as is typical in Glide. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Glide Apps.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have been experimenting with Glide Apps over the past few days.

Basically, Glide offers the opportunity to generate mobile apps using Google Sheets as a data source. Glide offers a wonderfully intuitive user experience when building apps. There are however, some items I would love to see: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Filters.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Glide offers a &quot;Search&quot; component, it would however, be amazing to provide filter buttons to update the view based on certain criteria. For example, you can currently provide a list of items, however, would it not be great to enable a switching mechanism based on a field with a specific set of values. For example, if you had an internal app listing project, the &quot;main&quot; view would show a listing of all the projects. However, you could have a &quot;Status&quot; colum, with enum values such as &quot;In Progress&quot; and &quot;Live&quot;. Based on that, you could then offer buttons, to toggle the view between listings that were &quot;Live&quot; or &quot;In Progress&quot; etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Map &amp;#x26; Location.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of the Map component is fantastic, however, it would be even better if the Map listing could be delimited to a specified area from the user&apos;s current location (if enabled) or based on a location entered by the user. This is a fairly common use case in terms of map/location based activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Instragram Video.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram video is becoming a very large part of video distribution, as such, it would be fantastic to have the ability to display/embed an Instragram video within an app. For example, specifiy a video column, then based on the url, could display a player for a YouTube, Vimeo or Instagram video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[NPM, CLI and Package Versions]]></title><description><![CDATA[After my build and formatting failures  yesterday , I started working with a sense of positivity despite the setbacks.

As it turned out, my new day would continue to be plagued with npm issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point during the day there was a power failure, this also happened right as I was busy installing some dependencies. My hunch is that this interruption to installation somehow took things off the rails. I had been in the process of installing the npm package &lt;code&gt;firebase-admin&lt;/code&gt; via the Firebase CLI. Not only would this installation not complete due to issues with node-gyp and xcode tools, it variously gave me repeating EACCESS errors despite being (re)connected to the internet (the power was back on by this stage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, after several attempts and some Googling I realised that since I have not used the Firebase CLI in quite some time, it was in need of an update. There was also, seemingly some conflict of rights in the sense that I needed to use sudo in order to get the installation of the updated firebase-admin to install correctly so that node-gyp could do what it needed. I once again needed to remove and re-install my node_modules in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, my takeaways from the past few days are this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have not used a particular CLI or project (i.e. packages in a while) make sure to check your versions in package.json as well as your various CLI versions. Make a note of these because version changes in the intervening can really mess you up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are later versions, take a look at what they mean for you, if possible, update and keep updating. This can be a pain, but at least you are then taking a pro-active approach towards it and actively educating yourself about the possible changes and impacts to be aware of. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to use nvm and my gut is to also gravitate towards npx. Admittedly, I have not used npx much, but the further you move away from global CLI and packages, the likely better of you are! &lt;/li&gt;

That &apos;automagical&apos; sense of satisfaction you get by having your document auto-formatted each time you save. Or the ease with which you can install specific tools or rapidly generate boilerplate code so that you can focus on what you are actually doing is fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, every now and then, while cruising on the developer tools highway you hit a pothole you did not see coming! I spent the better part of yesterday first trying to fix my app&apos;s build which, out of the blue, refused to build. Then, after finally resolving that issue, my code editor&apos;s format-on-save feature was replacing all my single-quotes with double-quotes all the while my linter was shouting at me to make them all single-quotes again... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I spent several hours trying to untangle the threads. In the end, as with many programming related difficulties, the solutions were very straight-forward, but as always, the journey towards those solutions was not! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build Failure.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a front-end web developer, I have long been attracted to &apos;building a mobile app&apos;. As such, with my experience in the Angular ecosystem, I have been working with Ionic v4. In essence, Ionic is a bridge on top of native features. To my mind, working with Ionic is very much like using Bootstrap to build the interface and very much like Angular to build the rest. Similarly, Ionic has it&apos;s own CLI layered on top of the Angular CLI. For those that are familiar, you run your app by executing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a point in the day, I was looking into using the so-called PWA Elements plugin to provide access to the local machine&apos;s Camera functionality. I ran: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install @ionic/pwa-elements&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And carried working. I then ran ionic serve and next thing noticed my build was not working. Reading the error message was not particularly enlightening either. In bright read it said the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schema validation failed with the following errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Data path &quot;.builders[&apos;app-shell&apos;]&quot; should have required property &apos;class&apos;.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[ERROR] ng has unexpectedly closed (exit code 1).&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;The Ionic CLI will exit.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched within my project for &quot;.builders[&apos;app-shell&apos;]&quot; to see if that would shed some light. No luck. I then Googled the message which quickly lead me to posts about inconsistencies between the version of the Angular CLI and a package known as @angular-devkit/angular-build. The solutions posted were straight-forward, basically, change the angular-build version and run npm install again. I tried this several times without success. Along the way I tried variations on the versions suggested as well as repeatedly removing my node_modules and re-installing them. I even went so far as to delete my local copy of the app, cloning it from repo and running it again. Still no luck. I then went so far as to clear my npm cache. But still, I kept getting the strange red error message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I decided to try the regular &lt;code&gt;ng serve&lt;/code&gt; command, which then threw up a much larger error not saying much, but saying a whole lot about rxjs. Sigh. In the end, after changing version numbers I noticed the error message had now changed from: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Data path &quot;.builders[&apos;app-shell&apos;]&quot; should have required property &apos;class&apos;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Data path &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; should NOT have additional properties (es5BrowserSupport)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok! Great! This was progress. Catching onto the es5BrowserSupport, I searched for this in my project. Not found. Googling this, I found posts mentioning that this was a field used by a certain version of Angular CLI within the angular.json file. Searching for this in my own, I did not find this in my angular.json file. So it did not seem to be the issue. After much failure, I looped back to this particular point and decided to add the field to my file. Again, no noticeable impact. However, once I removed the field and ran the build... voila! It worked! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Format Failure.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overjoyed that I could suddenly return to actual coding, I wroted some code, hit save and suddenly my file was auto-formatted precisely not how I wanted it! Ugh! I see a rabbit hole, I descend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I need to mention this, some time ago, I got really into my VS Code plugins and auto-formatting. At the time I was trying out a few different libraries such as React and Vue and as such, need to apply some work to my VS Code config. Admittedly, once I had it doing what I wanted between the various libraries and file types, i.e. .js, .ts, .jsx, .vue etc along with their associated code completiong, hinting and linting etc. I was quite chuffed with what I had! Since then, I have left it alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this is a blessing, a curse or a fatal sign of shallow-learning I don&apos;t know. But during my daily coding life, I come across a seemingly endless myriad of troubles. Over time, these develop into a way of problem-solving, or searching for solutions that I believe is of value in the wider sense. That being said, I also forget a hell of a lot. Now, faced with sudden auto-format violation of my documents, I realised that, for the life of me, I could not remember what I had done, or how I had set it up. Nevermind what had suddenly happened to change my previous settings! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it took me retracing my steps and memory to how VS Code editor settings work. At the time, it was getting late and I managed to fix my quote formatting problem. Whether any other of my auto-formatting settings have been disturbed I am not sure since I took that as a sign to call it a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, all this auto-magical automation and tooling is great! It just works! Sometimes, you know why, at others you don&apos;t. The problem is that when it doesn&apos;t work, it is often not clear why and the path to resolving it can sometimes not be very satisfying. At this point, I am still not sure why my build stopped working - yes, versions, but how and why did they change? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the formatting, again, I don&apos;t know what happened? Did I mysteriously press some kind of key combination that switched something in my editor that I did not notice? Did me closing down several workspaces and removing old projects from my view lead me to somehow changing an obscure setting in my editor? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do know, is that auto-magical could, also, in the worst case, lead one to auto-destruct if you are not careful! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Flexibility.]]></title><description><![CDATA[While doing research yesterday on how to improve my surf pop-up, I came across this  image  of the Performance Pyramid.

At the base lies Movement, which is defined as &quot;Movement quality as influenced by mobility and stability&quot;. In my mind, those two equate to flexibility and balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up I was very active. I spent my childhood tearing around outside whether on foot or bicycle and in later years I tore around hitting, kicking or throwing a ball in various ways. Despite all this, I was never flexible. I believe, I have a decent sense of balance though. When it comes to flexiblity, not so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have memories from long ago karate practice where we would sit, in what yoga calls &lt;em&gt;butterfly&lt;/em&gt; pose and I was amazed at the people that could get there knees onto the floor. To this day, I still cannot do this. However, I have been doing yoga. Innately, I knew that on some level, it would be good for me to become more flexible. Now, several months later, am I actually more flexible? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. Yes, I can more easily touch my toes, and more importantly, yoga has taught me to breathe through the hurt the stretch brings on. No, because, to my mind, being flexible means you can do these things easily, which is not the case with me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the flexibility question, I do believe I am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slowly loosening up. To some extent progress has been impeded by injuries. For several weeks I had neck and arm/shoulder pain that would not go away. I also have a hip and wrist injury that keeps rearing its head each time I fall on it while skateboarding. To top it off I have a muscle in my left butt which seems to be far tighter than it should be. After all these months of comparatively intense physical exertion, I would have thought my body would be feeling far looser, supple and more energetic than it does. Every morning when I wake up, I am tight all over, and by the end of a physically challenging day I am exhausted. This does not seem to fall in line with what I would have expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I have really come to enjoy the release of muscles and tension that yoga brings about. Whenever I have finish a session, there is a sense of release. A subtle injection of energy and possibility into my body that was not there before. Regardless of my doubts regarding my flexilibity, I will continue in the understanding that over time. Likely a very long time, there will be benefits to be had. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Training Wheels.]]></title><description><![CDATA[The other day I was having a conversation with a surf instructor, I asked him whether, for someone like me that is just starting out in…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/post054/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/post054/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was having a conversation with a surf instructor, I asked him whether, for someone like me that is just starting out in surfing should be looking to move to surfing on shortboards or to keep surfing longboards as I have been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His answer was simple, but I found it surprisingly meaningful. He equated surfing on a longerboard with riding a bicycle with training wheels down a hill*. If you are comfortable and ready to take the wheels off to ride down the hill, then by all means, go for it. But there is nothing wrong with keeping the training wheels on until you can ride down the hill confidently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, the conversation lead me to what I was already feeling - I think it will be better for me to stick with the longer boards for now so that I can catch more and more waves, more confidently. Considering today&apos;s conditions, which were swampy and mushy at best, I took a 9ft out and despite the challenging conditions, I felt somehow, that the waves I caught showed some improvement in speed and movement along the wave. I also tried to be a little more expansive with my movements which, very subtly felt like they went quicker and smoother than before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to get my lazy, sort-of-drop-knee, pop-up fixed...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No disrepect meant to longboard riding - longboarding is as much a skill and art itself. To that effect, it may even be harder to make longboarding look good! It just fits with the analogy in the sense that a longboard is easier for a beginner to stand up on, easier to catch more waves and in the right conditions, easier to paddle too. For beginners, smaller boards are akin to riding a bicycle on with the training wheels off: harder to balance, harder to paddle, hard to stand-up on and stay on. &lt;/li&gt;

He has a YouTube channel where he posts skateboarding videos. He is not a pro skateboarder, but he is a father, husband and has a job. Being of a similar age and getting back in skateboarding, I found it interesting to hear what he had to say about skateboarding in his thirties and what progression means to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spoke about skateboarding and progression in particular as momentum. In order to progress, you need to maintain momentum which means skating regularly. In his view, this means that he tries to skate 3-4 times a week. His focus is primarily skating on the weekend, since then he has the time for it. However, he spoke about how important it is for him to get a skate or two in during the week in order to keep in touch with the activity. Then, over time, this builds his progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with this view, the difference in my case is that I tend to think about it in terms of consistency or continuity. It is better to only skate 2-3 times a week consistently for 12 months on end, than to skate every day for 2 moths month and then not skate for 3 and then to resume and skate everyday for a month or two, and then not do it again for a while. Unfortunately, that has been the pattern for me. I tend to get into a zone where I will get into something, pick up a great deal of momentum in that I do the activity as much as a physically can and then, at some point, that momentum falters. A gap then emerges, first a few days turns into a few weeks which turns into few months and then all momentum is completely lost and progress reverses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking on it, I am not entirely sure how this happens. In some respects, I am quite extreme in this way - all or nothing. It is as if the beacon of progress fires me up and it burns bright and I make considerable progress and then, possibly through a mixture of hitting a plateau, getting tired or injured and then having my focus shift through a a busy or stressful period at work and then suddenly that momentum turns into wastefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you want to call it, be it momentum, continuity or consistency, the important thing, possibly even most important thing, is to maintain it over a long, extended period of time. Try not to get large gaps, granted, occassionally you need a rest and maybe a break from something for a while - but then it is all the more important to ensure that you get back on the board or bike or whatever it might once the break is over. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mind and Progression.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the past few months, I have significantly increased my level of physical activity.

I originally started jogging on a regular basis to improve my overall fitness. Once that was underway, I started wakeskating again after many years. Having really gotten into that again I started pushing around on the skateboard once more. While I have been on the road, travelling, I took some surf lessons and have been surfing several times a week. I decided to bring my mountain bike along on the trip and gone riding a few times too. This then lead me to trying out a dirt jump bike which has become a new fascination for me. Last on the list is that I tried out climbing. Through all of this, I have also mostly been keeping up an almost daily yoga/stretching routine. (Unfortunately my regular exercise and running routine has falled away - mostly because, doing several of these activities a day means I am typically to tired or sapped of energy to do all of it. Also of note, is that my wakeskate season has come to an end).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these activities involve, and require (to some extent) progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: A pure athletic activity such as running hopefully involves you both feeling fitter and stronger overall as well as being able to regularly run further and/or faster. Both however, are markers of progression and in this case, the progression is effectively how your body acts and responds to the activity thereafter. There is also a mental component in that you gain confidence or a sense of well being that you are getting fitter/strong/healthier etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, exercise hopefully involves being able to do more repetitions or at least recover quicker from sets of exercises. Again, this is primarily physical, with a mental component of confidence and an increasing sense of well being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sports such as wakeskating or skateboarding, there is a physical component in terms of physical capability or fitness. Along with a greater sense of accomplishment since being able to run, in and of itself, is not particularly &lt;em&gt;difficult&lt;/em&gt;. That is to say, everyone can run to a greater or lesser extent. It is not &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; to run. It is however, significantly more difficult to just stand and ride comfortably on a skateboard or a wakeskate. Firstly, you need to find a centre of balance, then you need to learn how to turn, how to control your speed, how to go up or down an incline etc. What it comes down to, is skill. Effectively, a combination of both physical capability as well as control of another object separate to your body. This differentiates it from activities such as running, swimming, or yoga in that those activities are purely concerned with mastering and controlling your body. Boardsports are primarily about mastering both your body and the board. This fundamental difference is what exponentially opens up the possibilities available to a rider and elevates the importance of progression to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, when taking part in something like skateboarding or wakeskating, fitness, speed etc only matter in so far as they influence your ability to do tricks. First comes the challenge of actually being able to even do a trick - the path towards landing one is typically one of continual trial and error. Once you have landed it, the path then move towards landing it again and again. Once you have achieved this a few times, the level moves once more towards landing it regularly or every time. Once that is locked in, the progression moves more towards the height or pop you can do the trick at, or the style you can add to it. Once that is on the go, you start looking at learning to do the trick up, down, over or onto something and so it continues in a neverending cycle and push to progress and improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this cycle has been natural ever since I first started skateboarding. Then, once I tried snowboarding, it was a similar story - different only in the fact that I live in a country that is mostly devoid of snow. As a result, the progression story there was intense during the times I was actually able to ride. Similarly, when I learned to wakeboard and then shortly thereafter switched to wakeskating, the pursuit of progression has always been there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started mountain biking. Now, I have, on occassion, mountain biked in my life. Mostly because I enjoy riding bikes. And secondly, because, similar to running, I saw mountain biking as a way to improve my fitness - but in a far more enticing and enjoyable setting. Additionally, it activated the element of fun more than running in that you would often find sections on the trail where you would pick up speed, or you would like the way a corner banked or how some terrain flowed. It was however, never hooked into the progression side of things in the same way that any of the boardsports were... until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since going to The Bike Park in Constantia to ride my mountain bike. Something has activated in me that, had a particular line or path in that park not existed, I don&apos;t think would have happened. Granted, I saw kids jumping their bikes, and I saw their were jumps there, but similarly, I have seen BMXers jumping their bikes at skateparks most of my life, and it never activated my desire to learn to do it. It is weird, but sometimes one just does not associate oneself with an activity - I have ridden a BMX at a skatepark once or twice before many years ago, but it felt more like I was going to hurt myself than fun. If one is not comfortable riding a BMX, going up or down quarterpipes on them for a few minutes might not be a good idea! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, at The Bike Park, I noticed one of the &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; trails had two small tabletop jumps on them. Having seen someone jump them, I thought that they looked benign enough for me to attempt them without hurting myself. So I started giving them a go and steadily started pushing myself a little faster and harder each time until I got to the point that it &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; as if I might just be getting a little bit of air. I think there was just something that felt right about the flow of the jumps and how much fun it was to be doing them over and over again that clicked something in me. I wanted more of this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point, that I noticed that the bike a kid that was effortlessly doing jumps on was not a mountain bike. Granted, I knew you got different types of bikes, but as I looked at it, I noticed his was different, so I asked him about it and he told me it was a dirt jump bike. Going home that evening, I realised that The Bike Park rented bicycles. The following day I did not feel like loading my bike, so I decided to see if I could try a bike more suited to the terrain. When I checked in, I said I wanted to rent a bike and the guy behind the counter asked me if I wanted to rent a mountain bike or a jump bike. I chose jump bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a jump bike. Differences to a regular mountain bike? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has one brake. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has one gear. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seat is far lower. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The frame is a little more angled. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The handlebars are wider. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simpler, less moving parts, less to break. To my mind it also lighter, but I can&apos;t be sure...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a difference! Where my mountain bike previously felt sluggish in getting into the air, the jump bike just seemed to float easily up into it! Where there was kindling that was just starting to smoke at the edges, this suddenly caught alight! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I have not taken my mountain bike back to The Bike Park. I have only been renting jump bikes there and been loving it! This entire piece is basically one long winded way of saying that I have been bitten by the dirt jump bug. I can now easily jump the original two jumps I was attempting and can now comfortable clear the two smaller rollers in the park. I have not quite figured out the big rollers yet, but my biggest achievement was yesterday when I managed to actually &lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt; the first two jumps in the jump line! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ridiculous as it sounds, being a full grown man, I now feel like one of the &lt;em&gt;big kids&lt;/em&gt; at the park that can ride the jump line. I have not quite figured it out yet since my turn into the berm is not where it should be and I cannot yet clear the last jump yet... but, slowly but surely we are getting there! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this is such a big deal for me is two fold: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day I was trying the jumps out, I saw a kid absolutely nail himself on the first jump. He basically crashed into the opposite side of the jump, went head over handlebars and hurt himself more than I would care to. Needless to say, that kind of put me off attempting that jump. Yesterday though, the park was packed, and my typical lines through the park were absolutely congested - my favourite jump line was overcrowded with children all over the place making it near impossible to get a clear run through and my other favourite line was covered in mud since the sprinkler on the corner was on all day making it rather unpleasant to ride through. This left me only one option when it came to jumping - to face up to the scary one! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With certain sports, there are levels or tricks you associate with progression. In a way, people who do this thing or that thing are the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; deal. For example, in skateboarding, if you can do a stylish kickflip, that means something. Similarly, if you can drop in on a mini-ramp and do a couple tricks turn to turn, it means something. Like, you can hold your own, you have done some time, you have learned some thing. Being able to hit those first two jumps on that line are like a miniature badge of honour becuase the small jump represents a split in those that ride at the park. Everyone can pretty much ride everywhere in the entire park, regardless of skill. But that particular jump, only people who can actually do a jump can hit it. So in my mind, Level 1 passed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now its all about making it look better and more natural! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Climbing.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Yesterday I went to a climbing gym called CityROCK in Cape Town.

This place is amazing! As you walk in, the facility looks fantastic. Everything is clean, well lit, the staff are friendly and welcoming and my impression was just one of overall quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my recollection, I have only ever climbed on a climbing wall once in my life before. This was over 12 years ago at a climbing wall in Durban. As such, I have practically no experience of it and had no idea what to expect. As a first time visitor, I filled in an indemnity form, paid for my day pass and climbing shoe and harness rental. A staff member then took me through the basics of the facility layout. Basically, they offer 3 types of climbing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bouldering - which is more technical, lower to the ground climbing without ropes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climbing - your typical climbing with a minimum of two people involved, one climbing and one belaying. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto-belay climbing - for solo climbers where you are belayed by a safety device. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was on my own, I made use of the auto-belay walls. Basically, there is a climbing rope which you clip into and you start climbing. If you are jump off/repel from the wall, or fall while climbing, the rope automatically eases you down the wall at a gentle pace. While it seems obvious that such devices would exist in 2019, I admit I did not even know such a thing existed, and I am glad it did because without these, I would not have been able to climb on my own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cimbing walls represent a great variety of difficulties, starting with a level 10 at the easiest and progressing up to I don&apos;t know where. I started with some easy walls, opting to pretty much to move from left to right along the walls, attempting all the routes I could amongst the auto-belay options. Granted, I was a little nervous of the auto-rope at first - once I reached the top, I opted to down-climb a little way before thrusting out away from the wall. There was no need for this though, the more you climb, you eventually just start puhing off to descend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the climbing, it is something very different to what I am used to. I take part in many physical activities, most of which involving riding on some sort of board or bicycle. Climbing is totally different - it is intensely physical, but not in the way running or other high tempo cardio activities are. Climbing requires a much more deliberate approach, both physically and mentally. I was able to climb all the walls I attempted until I reached my limit for the day. Whether it was that my fingers are not yet strong enough to hold the type of grips I encountered on this route, or wehther I was just to tired to keep the holds, I finally could not get past this one section of a route. The particular region was a challenge because, for the most part, up until this route, most of the routes I had been climbing had rather easy to grip holds and the positioning was such that it was not particularly difficult to make the moves. This combination however was really tricky for me and after several attempts I resolved to call it a day - mostly because I felt I was too tired to tackle this route. Had I been fresh, I think I may have been able to make a better challenge for it, but considering it was my first time climbing and was already tired, I was not in the right mindset physically or mentally to get through it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, this brief experience was revealing to me in many ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing is a unique combination of physical and mental challenge wrapped up in confronting fear, discomfort and physical limitations. Granted, I am fully ware that climbing on a gym wall is nothing close to climbing an actual rock wall, neither in terms of skill, feel, height, exposure, weather and any number of external elements that make real climbig so incredibly challenging and dangerous. However, it strikes me that while being high off the ground and exposed is obviously dangerous, the interesting thing for me was that the failure is uniquely personal and unspectacular - mostly coming down to not being able to make seemingly simple movements successfully, or to hold a position appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure I have a natural affinity or physicality for climbing. Typically, I have been very sporting in my life. As a youngster, I had a knack as well as a determination for certain sports - mostly ball sports which involved using equipment. In pure athletic endeavours such as athletics and swimming, I was less successful. Granted, I was not without ability, but I think I have been more suited to an ability to learn to use something in combination with my body than to purely use my own body. As I type this, it is a concept I have never thought of before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realisation that what Alex Honnold does is even further beyond my comprehension than I realised. I already considered what he does as beyond any scope of my comprehension. Now, it is multiplied out exponentially in comprehension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TechMeme Ride Home.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a web developer, and having more than a passing interest in the broader technology industry, the Tech Meme Ride Home is a great way to keep in touch with the ongoing news in the sector. At only about 15-20 minutes long. It is easy to listen to while doing other things like cooking or cleaning up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Daily.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Daily is an incredibly well produced show by The New York Times. There is one episode, Monday to Friday, typically digging into a big story of the moment. I feel it is a good way to get an overview and understanding of some of the larger news stories of the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Talk Show with John Gruber.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a long time Daring Fireball listener, this one is a no-brainer. A long form, discussion style podcast that has been runningn for many years. I believe this show is the first podcast I listened to back when it was still part of the 5by5 network. At the time, John and his former co-host Dan were, at the end of each show, discussing one of the James Bond films as they watched them. As a fan of tech and Bond, it was a great combination. I have been listening on and off since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Tim Ferris Show.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have not been listening as often as I used to, the Tim Ferris Show used to be one of my staple shows. The recent interview with Neil Gaiman was incredible though. I highly recommend it, especially if you are a fan of Gaiman&apos;s writing. Neil, for those who don&apos;t know, is the author of books such as American Gods, Anansi Boys, Neverwhere and The Graveyard Book. All of which I have listened to in audiobook format. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Feast for Crows.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the past few months, I have been listening to the audiobook series version of Game of Thrones.

Mostly, in anticipation for the now playing series, but also because I was curious as to how closely the series hews to the books. Up until A Feast for Crows, it seemed to me that, for the most part, the books and the series were in step as to the general spirit and events that were happening. Details were often different, namely the portrayal of Ramsey, the Wildling attack on the wall as well as a few other character subtleties. There is much internal dialogue and dream sequences in the books that would be difficult to render on screen. For the most part though, to me the series was mostly well representing the books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Feast for Crows, seems to me to be a point of major departure. I think, for me, this has been the weakest book in the series. The entire books makes barely a mention of the primary characters John Snow, Danaerys Taergaryen and Tyrian Lannister and is filled with minute court conspiracies and sideplots that do not even make an appearance in the series at all. There are also several, quite significant differences in how certain plotlines are developing. The arch of the stories, and the inherent conflict points are still there, but the representation of how they occurr differe drastically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my mind there is one significant departure in this book from the series in both storyline and feeling in that this book tells of a significant split between Jamie and Cersei Lannister. I do not remember if this is hinted at in the series, but this book goes into great detail as to the deterioration of their relationship. There is also an very long and deep dive into the details of the Dawnish kingdom in the aftermath of the Red Viper&apos;s death at the hands of the Mountain which is very briefly and differently related in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is still a good read and is has a much strong thread of dark humour running through it. I really enjoy the characterizations, but this book felt more like filler and moved at a snails pace. As I write this, I now realise there was also no chapters (that I recall) that detailed Bran&apos;s movements either. Considering John, Danaerys, Tyrian and Bran are likely the most compelling characters in the stories, this is a big loss I think. Neither, has there been any mention of the Night King. Additionally, there is a bizarre twist in that Catlin Stark is still present after The Red Wedding. I am not quite sure, but she is seemingly a zombie of some sort. Not a flesh-eating one, but she was raised up from the death. I won&apos;t get into any more details since as I go, I notice more and more differences in detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None the less, I am now starting A Dance with Dragons, which I hope will be significantly more centred around the primary characters than the endless parade of sideshows A Feast of Crows represented. It seems Martin really got into the weeds and &lt;em&gt;inside baseball&lt;/em&gt; with this book in terms of the world of Westeros... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s to hoping he got back to the real game in the next! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Schooling.]]></title><description><![CDATA[As is often the case, Fred Wilson put up an  article  yesterday regarding schooling in the US and the increasing number of charter schools…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/post045/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/post045/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As is often the case, Fred Wilson put up an &lt;a href=&quot;https://avc.com/2019/04/opting-out-of-the-legacy-model/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; yesterday regarding schooling in the US and the increasing number of charter schools, with special reference to the rise of homeschooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&apos;t have children, so I do not have skin in the game on this topic, but it did get me to thinking about my own feelings towards my experience of schooling. Granted, I left school 18 years ago, so I hope that much has changed in the intervening years. The more I thought about it though, the greater my feeling was that, at least in my case, schooling and the way school measures success is fundamentally misguided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through school and possibly other forms of education, the primary way to evaluate your progress and understanding of a topic is to write tests or exams. Effectively, this is a means of asking a question, and providing an answer which is then evaluated. The problem is that such a system sets up the wrong way of understanding the world and your progress through it. It creates the wrong expectations and importantly, creates the wrong incentives towards learning and success in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, for the 12 years of schooling, your primary measure of success and progession is &lt;em&gt;passing tests&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;getting grades&lt;/em&gt; which determine whether you move forward or remain where you are. In effect, you are rewarded for your efforts on a measurable scale. The problem with this approach is that when you step out the door into the real world. The measures and scales are thrown completely out the window. Doing X does not result in Y. The system of effort to reward is completely different. Take workplace politics for example: In the workplace, doing good work will hopefully get you some measure of whatever it is you seek. Be it a raise, promotion, more responsibility, recognition amongst your peers etc. However, there is no guarantee of this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a software project as another example, there are factors that determine a measure of right-ness or wrong-ness. Clearly, if the code written results in slow performance and the user interface is poorly laid out, then the project may fail on some level. Or funnily enough, it may still succeed. However, you could have a well designed, well written project fail completely regardless. Any number of factors can sink a project. Likewise, you can have people in jobs who are seemingly terrible at what they do, or at managing people and projects. Yet sometimes such people seem to succeed and keep moving onward or upward in position despite this. In my experience, there was no schooling that caters to this type of environment and dynamic, nor even acknowledged it&apos;s existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schooling teaches you nothing of this. To my mind, schooling teaches you only half the story (if that). It teaches you the knowledge building blocks if you will. This is necessary and this is good. The problem as I see it now with my schooling, was that it pretended as if it was everything. That it was somehow a microcosm of life. That you must do well in school to succeed in life. That you must do well in school and you will be rewarded. That you must follow the rules, and you will progress. This is a lie. In school, you are often given success by someone. You play by someone elses rules and you get rewarded accoding to someone else&apos;s choices or opinions. The issue is that life, in general, is completely the opposite. Life has no rules of that nature. There are no guarantees to your progress other than your own determination and satisfaction to learn your own lessons and walk your own path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who find success often make their own games and their own rules. If they don&apos;t like one set, they find or create another set. Undoubtedly, schooling is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important, but it is not the be-all and end-all it makes itself out to be. It is a place where you learn and build foundational skills. It is completely up to you and your own initiative to figure out for yourself how to use to create you own success and find your own rewards thereafter. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eating Habits.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Eating habits are a strange thing.

Habit, being an operative word. How much of our eating is dictated by habit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say: all of it. If I look at my own eating habits, they definitely follow lines of habit and repetition. If you know how to make a handful of dishes, those are the dishes you will stick to in a pinch. So knowledge is one part. If you routinely go to this store, at that time, then you will also tend to buy the same things, in the same ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part is context or situation. For example, if you have worked a long day at the office and have sat in traffic for over an hour. Your priority, might be just to get home, have a shower and relax for the few hours you have before bed. If you are so inclined, this may mean that stopping at a fast food establishment is your go to option. In isolation, or on occassion, this might be okay. However, if you work late often, then it will rapidly become habit. A bad habit. Such an eating habit can then quickly cascade down into other areas of your life, such as exercise and general health and ultimately self-esteem if you find yourself becoming ever wider and heavier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, if you are then thinking about changing your eating habits, what you need to consider is not only food or cooking itself, but habit changes and on a deeper level such as lifestyle and mindset change. Taking the above example, if you are eating a lot of take away foods, which, with apps such as Uber Eats making this far easier than ever, to eat healthier means that you need to start from the root causes of the habit. Which might not even be related to food. This could mean, leaving work earlier, this may mean you need to re-arrange your work somehow since it could involve getting to work earlier, or being more disciplined about your process, priorities or time and energy management at work. It would also require planning ahead. In order to cook food, you need to have the necessary foods in the fridge or cupboard, which will mean you need some idea of what you are going to cook ahead of time. In any event, just from this example, you can see that all of these elements start to build up on one another. At the root of which, is a change of mind, heart and habit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, you need to embrace the idea of food or cooking as a hobby or an interest. Layered on top of that is the idea that hobbies are a way to wind-down and have fun. Even if hobbies are strenuos, they ultimately are a means of release. They get the mind and body into a better state. Take an interest in what you put into your body and accept that this takes time and skill (and money) to learn and develop. Much like any hobby. For me, a big switch was changing my mindset from seeing cooking as a chore on the steps towards feeling full, to seeing cooking as a way to wind-down, relax and ultimately, have fun. Primarily this involves putting on some good music, pouring a glass of wine and getting moving. Music is an important part of this. Since, while I often listen to music while working, I tend toward repetition in that I might play the same song, artist or album over and over again. It does not lend itself toward exploration. When playing music while cooking, I tend to explore more, listen to new suggestions and albums and just let it run. Skipping tracks if it ruins the vibe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondarily, and this might sound strange, but I find that cooking is a process of moving, the music gets my mind moving to a happier, more relaxed state. Then, mentally going through what I am going to cook, gets me physically moving through the kitchen and laying out the ingredients and utensils I need. Once all the necessaries are laid out, I then start to prep, which typically means chopping, cutting or doing whatever needs to be done to whatever needs to be cooked. Once that is done, I then start cooking. I tend to wash-up as I go too. Which involves more movement. This means I am continually moving, which, to my mind, combined with the music relaxing my mind, and the gentle movements relaxing my body, switch me into a totally different mindset than I was before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am no expert on food. I am no expert cook either. I have no input to give beyond the idea that, the key, at least for me, is that mindset switch: Move from seeing cooking as a chore to seeing cooking as fun way to wind down. It makes all the difference!   &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fun.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I recently discovered  The Bike Park  in Constantia.

Situated on the Uitsig wine farm. The bicycle park consists of a number of trails made up of a variety of dirt tracks, pump tracks, berms, table-top jumps, rollers, hips and various other constructions including a treeline bridge ride (with a corckscrew exit) and a large wooden berm. There is also a bike/rental shop that offers gear, repairs, rentals and even coffee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back to my childhood, without a doubt, the best gift I ever received was one Christmas when was gifted a BMX bicycle by my parents. Needless to say, I rode that thing non-stop for the entire holiday. Over the years, I have been on a few mountain bike rides. I enjoy riding bikes, and it is an especially fun way to see cities while travelling. I enjoy it enough, that a few months ago, I purchased a work colleague&apos;s old mountain bike. A red and black Scott mountain bike with shocks on the front. I had the tires upgraded to tubeless to reduce puncture issues. Since then, I have taken the bike out a few times, and decided to bring it along on my road trip because it was likely I would find plenty of good spots to ride. So far, this has been a good decision, but not until the bike park, did I realise just how good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that any bike riding experience will ever match up to when I first got my bike as a kid. I think that combination of excitement, joy and surprise at receiving something that activates your sense of adventure and freedom like a bicycle does as a child would be hard to match. Riding at the bike park came close though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ridiculously fun to ride laps upon laps of terrain, cruising through bermed corners, rolling over humps and learning to hit jumps on a bike after all these years. Admittedly, I was most attracted to learning to try and air my bike over the two small table-top jumps and trying to get faster and lower through the berms than casual riding, but I think, on some level, going hell for leather at these features is as close to that child-like bicycle riding experience on can get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, or it could have been seeing a father and his tiny little son (covered head to toe in a helmets and all manner of pads) tearing around the at track full speed, hollering and wooping, seemingly having the time of their lives that reminded me of that experience. Regardless, if you enjoy riding bikes, or you are a parent, looking for a place to have fun with your kids, look no further than The Bike Park in Constantia. The trails are varied enough that there is something for everyone and every skill level, and due to the layout of the park, you are never too far from any corner of it. Chances are, you will have just as much fun as your kids will! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Even if you are a mountain biker not looking for the type of riding this park offers, I would still encourage you to go and ride there. Riding these types of trails will increase your technical riding skills immensely. Since you are generally riding at speed, through tight corners, over angled and rolling terrain, I am sure that your general trail riding ability will increase significantly. Especially since you are doing laps, you can actively focus on improving certain skills through repetition at faster and faster speeds. That being said, it is advisable to ease into it and get the feeling of the place before you start putting the pedals down hard. It is really easy to over find yourself going off the trails with rather comical and/or painful results!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Levels.]]></title><description><![CDATA[When I was young, I used to skateboard.

I really enjoyed it, and through the years, I went through some phases were I would get back into it. However, as I got older, I did it less and less. Especially over the last 7 years, I hardly ever did. When I was younger, not doing something for a while, didn&apos;t mean losing the ability, one just needed to &lt;em&gt;rediscover&lt;/em&gt; it. This happened pretty quickly for me. This time, it has been different. Starting to skate again has been difficult. It took me quite a while just to get the minimum basics back. Even then, my tricks are not as good or comfortable as they used to be. I have lost most of them and have slowly started trying to re-learn them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I bring this up is because, when going to skateparks and doing skill-based activities. Whether it be skateboarding, or wakeboarding, snowboarding, mountain biking etc. Any sport or skill where there is a long anf strong line of progression to be made, it is really important for the facilities available to reflect that progression. When you are starting out and learning something for the first time, especially with something you fall and can hurt yourself, it&apos;s important that a facility have features to represent a beginner level of skill. Features that are small and easy to step up to and learn on. From there, there then needs to be a steady progression or variety of features to build up your skills on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in the USA, working at a ski resort, it was the first time I witnessed true attention to this assistance with progression. Firstly, when learning to ski or snowboard, the instructors, take you very slowly through the steps and routines to learn the skill the basics on the flat snow first, then, as you increase your level of comfort, they walk you a few steps up a very mellow slope to try new exercises and so forth, up until you are actually going down a fairly mellow slope on your own and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way that the skill is taught progressively, in the same way the features in the terrain parks were progressive. Where I was, there were two terrain parks, the beginner/intermediate park and the main terrain park. The beginnger/intermediate park had two distinct &lt;em&gt;lines&lt;/em&gt; in it. On the one side, was the beginner line which had basic very small, basic features and jumps (they are not really jumps - just humps). These were really small and inviting enough for beginners to get their first taste of riding a rail, box or jumps on and to gain confidence on. The intermediate line, then had progressively larger features (but not too large) that would be within grasp of a more progressed beginner or intermediate rider. Finally, once you were capable in this park, you could at least ride through the &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; park and take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now again, the main park had several lines through it, with a large variety of features. Most of them were larger than in the other park, but mostly, there was variety and progression. For example, in the jump section, there were 7 kickers (jumps). The first 3 were all within grasp of an intermediate with the first and even second being relatively small. From the third jump onward, they got progressively bigger with the final two being pretty big. Similarly, the rails and boxes had a large variety on show, so you could, try the features that were within reach and leave the scarier stuff out. Towards the bottom of the park, there was a set of really large rails and stairs that you would only hit if you were pretty advanced in your riding, but really, the whole setup just &lt;em&gt;breathed&lt;/em&gt; progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, one cannot compare one of the best resorts in the north-east, with a dedicated team and resources to develop it to other facilities in other sports, but the concept holds. I believe, for a skatepark, or skill-based sports facility to be successful, both as a business and in fostering a community around the sport, the facility &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; cater to multiple levels of skill. And if in doubt, better to cater &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; toward the beginner/intermediate side than the advanced. Primarily because, if you cannot support the beginner in their progression, you will be left with precious few advanced riders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, you might find that more advanced riders might become &lt;em&gt;bored&lt;/em&gt; if the features are too basic. But the reailty is that in skill based sports like this, even with smaller features, advanced riders can still gain a lot of progression and have a lot of fun on them. That being said, one would need to support these riders too. However, from a business perspective, if you were able and capable to support and grow enough of the beginners and intermediates through progression, finding and making available resources to cater to larger features would come naturally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skateboarding will always be different, however, skatepark owners would do well to consider the beginner/intermediate rider. Cater to the basics, the building blocks. Small mini-ramp, small box, small rails where one can ride lines and progress and flow. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[When The Going is Good.]]></title><description><![CDATA[When the going is good you need to get going!

Or better yet, make hay while the sun shines! This is a concept that has been on my mind for some time. As I was starting to wakeskate more often, I took the approach that if the sun was out (and when it was not) I was going to go a ride. Primarily because, if you have a day of great sun, no wind, the water is going to be perfect for riding and you don&apos;t know when you will next get another day like it. Weather can change, wind can pick up, rain might come and then conditions may not be as favourable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson was learned again when I was in Langebaan to do a kiteboarding course. Kiteboarding, of course, requires wind. At least 12 - 15 knots for a beginner is a good windspeed. The first day I was in town, on the beach, the conditions were perfect for learning and I had my first two lessons. For the next 4 days there was almost no wind to speak of and one could not even get a kite up in the air. Fortunately, I at least got some time on the kite and in the water so that I at least learned something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, today, I went down to Muizenberg beach for my second surf lesson and what a contrast to yesterday. It was overcast and windy. Worse, the wind was not the favourable off-shore that you want for shaping up good waves. It was onshore, and the swell was more inconsistent. The waves for lumpy, mushy and washy. Still, I got in the water and caught some waves. I had to work far harder for them in terms of paddling and lifting over or diving under white water. It was so much tougher and the waves were not as rewarding as yesterday. Still, great learning experience! Conditions are likely not in your favour more often than they are and if you can surf or do whatever it is that you are doing in less than ideal conditions, then come good conditions and you will be so much better for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is though, yesterday, I considered staying in the water and doing another lesson. I was in the zone, excited and more importantly, the conditions were just so good. Today, I regretted not doing another session just that little bit. Granted, had I done another session, I would likely have been super tired and fatigued today. And maybe, going on longer would have lead to diminishing returns as I started to tire, but the thought still stuck in my head. When the going is good, keep going because you don&apos;t know what tomorrow&apos;s weather may bring! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surfing.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am currently in Muizenberg in the Western Cape.

The goal coming down here was to learn to surf. Muizenberg is one of the best places for this. Nice long sandy beach, sand-bottom under the water and most importantly, consistent, beginner-friendly waves! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the first time I have surfed in years! The last time was more or less 3 years ago on a trip to Chile. This was completely different though, for one reason! Getting a real, one-on-one surfing lesson. In the past, while surfing, I struggled with the pop-up. That is, moving from lying down and paddling to standing up and riding. Often times I would tip over on the pop-up. The reason for this, I discovered from my instructor was that I was not placing my foot in the center of the board. This my friends, made &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the difference! I cannot even tell you how much fun it was riding today! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waves were perfect! No wind, no side-current or wash, just regular, clean waves of decent beginner height. I even managed to catch a few open-faced waves in front of the white-water. So much fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why I did not ever get a surf lesson before. I recommend it whole-heartedly! There are so many small tips and nudges you get that push you in the right direction and help you improve your surfing enough to get the point that you are at least catching waves. Granted, I have some prior experience, mostly with other boardriding, but the trick with surfing, at least for the beginner, is the paddling, the wave selection, and the pop-up, and in this area I really lacked, but now, I feel I have, at least that bit of knowledge to take me to the next small step! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top take-aways from today are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a lesson, it is worth it! Better yet, take more. I have another tomorrow. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When placing your hands for the pop-up, do not hold the rails, place them flat on the board, just under your shoulders. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When popping, swivel your hips and get your front foot up and onto the middle of the board - if your foot is too far on the sides, you will topple over. In previous times, this happened to me time and time again and, not knowing any better, I just kept trying to make it. Sometimes I did, but mostly I didn&apos;t. Today, I caught pretty much every single wave I paddled for, which, for me, was a huge achievement! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I got my lessons from an instructor named James working at the Surf Emporium. If you are in town, Surf Emporium are great! The staff are super fiendly and helpful. The instructor was great! And they have lockers, change-rooms and hot showers! And for good measure, there is a Vida E Caffe inside their surf shop and it is right in front of the beach. Perfect! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[JBL Charge 4.]]></title><description><![CDATA[The JBL Charge 4 is a great portable speaker.

About the length and half the height of a regular toaster. It packs a pretty good punch when it comes to sound and volume. Little light on the treble, but the bass comes through well and in all honesty, for the price, it&apos;s a great piece of hardware. The pairing works easily, the battery lasts ages and to my ears, the quality is good enough for my purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have no use for it as I only have 1 speaker, but you can connect and sync multiple Charge 4s together which sounds like a great idea if you have more than one available. It does not have any smart features or personal assistant, however, I was only looking for a speaker that I can take with me on road trips and make use of in Airbnb rentals and the like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also impressed with quality of the packaging. The box is strudy with a nice, solid fitting foam interior that fits snugly around the speaker and protects it well. The charging cable and booklets are contained in a nice little black bock that slides into the side. What I really liked about the box was that it has a magnetic folding side so it snaps shut making it a pretty good substiture for a hardcase. Seems to me JBL have taken at least a page out of the old Apple packaging playbook. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weather.]]></title><description><![CDATA[For the past few days, I have been in Langebaan, down on the west coast of South Africa.

I came here to do a kiteboarding course. I have never kiteboarded before, and as a child, I seldom flew a kite. As such, this was altogether something new for me. While I have done several boardsports before, kiteboarding is more about the wind and the control of the kite, at least at first, than the board itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived in good wind conditions. And on my first day, had an enjoyable lesson. First off, my instructor, Martin, took me through some of the theory behind kitesurfing. For instance, wind conditions, wave or water conditions as well as elements that may affect this. In terms of wind, ideally, you want sidewind or crosswind conditions. Namely wind that blows along the beach or coastline. Off-shore wind, that is, wind blowing away from the shore is not good since there is no wind to bring you back to shore. On-shore, similarly is not good since there is no wind to take you away from the shore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the general wind direction, the quality of wind is important. The quality is basically whether the wind is consistent or gusty (blowing in bursts/inconsistent). Finally, and I think most obviously, the strength or speed of the wind is critical. Too little and you cannot kite, too strong and it will be unwise or downright dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also numerous other factors to consider such as the water conditions, for example what currents, rips, tides and waves are doing as well as the situation on the shore itself. For example, are there people or obstacles around you, rocks, barriers or any other elements (both in or out of the water) that may affect you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, all of the above, primarily, is determined by the weather. When living in the city, the primary question in terms of the weather is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the temperature?
Will it rain or not? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, it is not particularly important since the weather is primarily determining our choice of clothing and to some extent or activity. When doing something like kiteboarding, or surfing one is completely reliant on the weather and what it is doing. It brings your attention to, not only the weather, but the minute details of the weather and how it may change and evolve over the course of a day or week. In many ways, it first makes one more aware of weather and in turn, nature and I feel that over time, will bring you closer to a greater sense of care and involvement with that which will affect it over the longer term. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Security Online.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Considering online security is becoming increasingly important, and the fact that I am currently on a trip, on which I will often be using…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/post034/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/post034/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Considering online security is becoming increasingly important, and the fact that I am currently on a trip, on which I will often be using wifi, I decided to update my security practices in two ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, by using a VPN service.
Secondly, by using a password manager service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nord VPN.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided on using &lt;a href=&quot;https://nordvpn.com&quot;&gt;Nord VPN&lt;/a&gt;. Their reviews were positive, the pricing was good and considering they store very little data about you and your usage, I was happy. They also happened to be running a sale at the time I was researching, so I went with it. So far, using the app and service has been straight-forward. Sign up and setup was easy and thus far I have no complaints. Granted, I have not been online much the past week, so I am sure my opinion will evolve over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Special mention: IVPN.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ivpn.net&quot;&gt;IVPN&lt;/a&gt;. Primarily because Khoi Vinh, whose blog I follow and enjoy, uses it and wrote about his experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.subtraction.com/2019/03/11/vpns-for-all/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. IVPN is also the chosen VPN for &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/&quot;&gt;The Wirecutter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1 Password.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use 1Password as a password manager. Primarily, over the years, I have heard them be well recommended by various blogs I follow and as such, was inclined to make use of them. 1Password is a paid service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, while I am still new to this service, my first thought was that this was going to be a real chore to setup. Not because of the app or service itself, but because recalling all the services one uses regularly, as well as what their URLs, usernames and passwords are is chore. It is so easy to forget just how many online logins we have. Practically every site you use requires a username and password from you and all of these need to be strong and somehow memorable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I could not do it anymore. Having to remember and manage all those passwords was becoming something I know I have to do appropriately, but was struggling to keep up with. Hence me starting to use a service like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, I set aside some time to get it setup. The process was easy enough, and now that I have setup the majority of my accounts, I feel a lot better about my password situation. There are sure to be some more that I need to add. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nice touches in the app are that it shows your which of your passwords are weak, and where you have repeated passwords before. This makes it easy to manage and update these where appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have some work to do in terms of updating some of my accounts, but now that I have a base to work from, I am actually feeling quite positive about the prospect rather than dreading it! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ionic Notes.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Android. ng build // must ng build first so capacitor can wrap the app ionic capacitor add android ionic capacitor copy android ionic…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0108/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0108/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Android.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ng build // must ng build first so capacitor can wrap the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ionic capacitor add android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ionic capacitor copy android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ionic capacitor run android // will combine all the above 3x (ng build, add and copy) into one for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ionic capacitor run android -l // live reload in the emulator, will be running on ng serve behind the scenes instead of ng build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chrome: chrome://inspect &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see a emulator target listed under “Devices” -&gt; Click “Inspect” - this will connect a dev console to the running emulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iOS.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the above, however, you do need to make sure you have xCode Command Line Tools installed. You can check this by running from the command line: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xcode-select&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo gem install cocoapods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ionic capacitor add ios &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ng build&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ionic capacitor copy ios &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ionic capacitor run ios  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ionic capacitor run ios -l // live reload &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Safari, then select “Develop” menu, then select the “Simulator” device near the top. Should show an ip address and you can then view safari dev tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “Debugger” tab, there are quite a lot of files, so you can type in the filename you are looking for and it should find it. Then you can set breakpoints as usual. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Card.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Matthew Panzarino has a good overview of how  Apple Card  works.

&lt;p&gt;The whole piece is interesting, but what I really like is this - Panzarino writes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;* The physical Apple Card, of course, has no number. The app displays the last 4 digits of the card number that is on the mag stripe of the card only, you never see the full card number.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Apple provides a virtual card number and virtual confirmation code (CVV) for the card in the app. You can use this for non-Apple Pay purchases online or over the phone. This number is semi-permanent, meaning that you can keep using it as long as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can hit a button to regenerate the PAN (primary account number), providing you with a new credit card number at any time. This is great for situations where you are forced to tell someone your credit card number but do not necessarily completely trust the recipient.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a country where credit card fraud is rife, this is a fantastic feature! In South Africa, it is necessary that you &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; let your card out of your sight when it is being used by an employee in a store or elsewhere. This feature alone, would be worth it for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the type of user experience elevation that Apple does so well. They have the ability to take a process that is considered accepted and add steps that make you wonder why somone had not done it before. Clearly, much of what is detailed in the article is only possible due to Apple&apos;s position at the intersection of device, service, technology and user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this move pushes the rest of the credit card industry to adopt more intuitive and secure practices. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audiobook Subscription.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have been a great fan and listener of Audible since 2015.

I am currently busy with my 44th title. If you are not a customer, the way it works is, you sign up for the service and you pay a certain amount for credits. I am on the plan where you get 1 credit a month. 1 credit can then get you any audiobook you like, whether it is 1 hr long or 100 hours. You can of course purchase more credits if you would like to listen to more than your one book per month. I tend to buy books in the region of 15-40 hours, so typically, I am a credit or two behind since, I will not likely finish a book in a month if it is a long one 30-40 hours or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do however, wonder how an audiobook subscription fee, in the Netflix, all-you-can-listen style would fare? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would care less about listening time, and would likely start to widen the variety of books I listen to. For example, there are often books in the history/non-fiction/business type categories that I am interested in listening to, but since they tend to be quite short, I avoid them since then I would soon be out of credit. A system like that would also be more attuned to giving up on books you were not particularly enjoying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Apple&apos;s big push into services, it seems like an audiobook subscription service might be a way for them to differentiate their books offering from what Amazon offers. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yoga.]]></title><description><![CDATA[For the past two months I have been wakeskating.

Similar to wakeboarding, but without the bindings. Essentially, it is skateboarding on water. Skill-wise, it is a very challenging sport. Firstly, you are being pulled around the water at 30km/h. Secondly, you fall. A lot. Unlike skateboarding, if you fall, you cannot just get right up and try it again immediately. You first need to swim to the shore, then walk all the way back to the starting dock and only then can you start again. Depending on where on the course you fell, you may be swimming and walking considerably further. And so, it takes a lot of patience as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physically, it is just as challenging. Your arms are continuously worked, as are your legs, and I am sure everything in between. Back to the falling, it may be water, but hitting water at 30km/h full in the face, or straight onto your back or neck is not pleasant. Never mind getting water up your nose and into your ears... Yet, it is a lot of fun, and I really enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, my body has been taking a beating. My riding fitness has improved, so I can ride for 2-3 hours, and the evening/morning after stiffness has been lessening, but not to the extent I had hoped. As a result, I have started doing yoga and mobility exercises/stretches. On one hand, I do a session in the morning to release the stiff and soreness of the previous day&apos;s session. And on the other hand, it loosens me up for the day and gets my body off to a better start to the day. I am also hoping that, with repetition and regular practice of yoga, my flexibility and strength will improve which will counteract the pummeling my body takes on the cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been a flexible person physically. Even when I was a kid, touching my toes and, when doing a butterfly stretch, getting my knees on the ground was difficult if not impossible. I think all the years of sitting in front of a computer and going through phases where I was not very physically active have dramatically worsened the state of my flexibility. This morning, while doing a yoga session, I burst out laughing at some of the movements I had to do, because, looking at the form of the instructor and looking at the state and position I was in was not even closely comparable. Doing yoga, has made me realise just how terrible I am at using my own body. Granted, one needs to be very flexible and in tune with one&apos;s own movements to get some of these movements right, but realising just how inflexible I am, I had to laugh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None the less, I am going to stick with it. I am now trying to do two sessions a day, one in the morning to loosen-up and one in the evening to release. I don&apos;t know that I will ever be able to reach the form of some of the poses and movements, but I hope, that with time and repetition, that I will at least get closer! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Morning Routines.]]></title><description><![CDATA[While I was working at my previous job, my morning routine was as follows: Wake up at 4:55AM, shower, change, brush teeth and leave for work…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/post028/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/post028/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While I was working at my previous job, my morning routine was as follows: Wake up at 4:55AM, shower, change, brush teeth and leave for work as soon as possible in an attempt to beat traffic. Once at the office, I would make a cup of coffee and start working. This would be at around 06:30AM. I would then only have breakfast after 8, when the canteen opened. It might sound crazy to leave for work at 05:45 in the morning, but I had a commute to take care of. If I left any later, it would easily take me over an hour to 90 minutes to drive to work. Leaving early, beating traffic, meant it would only take me 30-40 mins at most. Additionally, because the office is relatively quiet early in the morning, at best, I could get some really productive work in. And at worst, I could at least &quot;get ahead&quot; of the day. I did this for many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could of course, have taken the alternate option, which would be to have a more personal morning and only leave for work after the traffic. This would mean me leaving after the rush (i.e. after 8AM), getting to the office around 08:30 - 09:30 depending entirely on what the traffic situation was during the rush. At that time, the day is already in full swing and emails and meetings are already in full flow. Chances of getting a good productive coding session in the morning were slim at best. In later times, a hot desk policy was initiated because space was at a premium. And so getting into the office &quot;late&quot; meant that you would likely need to hunt for a desk and have to sit in a random spot, which may or may not have a good screen and position setup. Needless to say, I was not enamoured with plan B.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that I am working independently, I am able to set my own routine and schedule. As such, I want to have a healthier, more fulfilling start to my days. A start that prioritises sanity and stability instead of traffic and schedules. A start the takes care of personal priorities through habit. As such, I have been doing the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake up at 6AM since I still want a relatively early start to the day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a morning journal for 5-10 minutes to release any random thoughts and get clarity. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate for 3 minutes to get my mind settled and focused. (I do the Daily Headspace meditation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise for 30-40 minutes which typically involves an ever changing mix of exercise, stretching and yoga. (Typically I used Nike Training Club or Asana Rebel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Breakfast and eat it while reading a few blog posts from my RSS feed (via Feedly, usually Daring Fireball, Seth&apos;s Blog, AVC or Ben Thompson). (15 - 20 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make coffee and settle down to write a blog post. (30 - 40 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shower and brush teeth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start working. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it takes me about 2.5 hours to do all the above. Since I don&apos;t have a commute anymore, I gain that time for exercise. The huge benefit for me though is that I have taken care of some of the most important parts of my day and the day has only just begun! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind, my body, my soul and my stomach are all happy and I am all clear to focus on the important work that needs to get done during the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Leaving during rush is a no go for me. I did this for a while, but after too many days of sitting in traffic for hours on end due to some incident I decided to not do this ever again. One day it took me over 3 hours to get to work!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Habit Building.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Blogs have been a huge part of my online and learning experience over the years.

I still read an enormous amount via RSS feeds of my favourite blogs. Blogs might be &quot;old fashioned&quot;, but I am an avid reader and fan of them. Blogs, are very much the pre-cursor to the current rising podcast trend. Most successfull bloggers have podcasts. What I love about RSS is that, it is like you have a direct line into the mind of some of the most intelligent, smart and interesting people out there. On a regular basis, you receive pieces of their their thought process, their insights, and the way their thinking on certain topics evolves over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, few of us, will ever get the opportunity to pick the brains of the brightest and smartest out there, or to have a conversation with them. However, by subscribing to their blog via RSS or email or however you choose to follow a blog, you get a similar type of scenario, but extended and elaborated over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot overstate the value of this in my life. That I have had the opportunity to, in a sense, be a fly on the wall to the ongoing through processes and outputs of some really smart people out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same light, I want to begin to try it for myself. To write repeatedly, and regularly and put the words and thoughts out there. One of the blogs I follow, AVC, is written on the daily by venture capitalist Fred Wilson. As I understand it, he sits down to write his daily post every morning before he gets started with his day. I am going to attempt to do the same. I am a big believer in habits and habit building and this is a habit I want to add to my daily process. Before I start my work for the day, I am going to write a post on a topic on my mind. This is the first. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Video Learning.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am a big fan of online, video based learning.

In a field such as programming, I find it works very well. One, being programmers, we already spend a lot of time on the computer. Second, switching between the video you are watching and the code you are writing in the environment you are working in is quick and seamlesss. Lastly, I find it hugely valuable to see how other programmers think through problems, how they code, how they think through the code. It has taught me a lot and I would encourage any programmer (or anyone else for that matter) to try it out! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much to be learned out there, and so many good resources through which to do so. Here are some options I would recommend: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Udemy.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com&quot;&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; is a large marketplace. Anyone can upload a course and anyone can buy a course. There is a huge variety of content available covering many wide-ranging fields. From a programming perspective, I would recommend the following instructors: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/&quot;&gt;Maximilian Schwarzmuller&lt;/a&gt; - He teaches a wide range of topics, mostly JavaScript and Angular related, though he does cover React, Vue and several other topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/&quot;&gt;Stephen Grider&lt;/a&gt; - Stephen is another great teacher and focused mostly on the React and related ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/user/reed-barger/&quot;&gt;Reed Barger&lt;/a&gt; - Reed is also more React based, however, his courses are not so much courses as they are code alongs. He rapidly codes through various app examples. He does not explain the code, or teach you how, but I find it great to code along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Angular University.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe Vasco, who is the teacher behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular-university.io&quot;&gt;Angular University&lt;/a&gt; had his start on Udemy, but I have watched several courses on his own site. As the name suggests, he is focused on Angular and the Angular ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ultimate Courses (formerly Ultimate Angular).&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Motto is a Google Developer Expert and runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://ultimatecourses.com&quot;&gt;Ultimate Courses&lt;/a&gt;. I first came across his site, then called Ultimate Angular, as I was brushing up on my AngularJs skills. He created three very good courses on the topic. Since then, he has expanded his site with several courses on Angular, Typescript and the Angular ecosystem. He has since rebranded the site and it looks like the course content will expand to cover vanilla JavaScript topics too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mosh Hamedani&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://programmingwithmosh.com&quot;&gt;Mosh&lt;/a&gt; also seems to have originally built his following through Udemy. Now he runs his own site independently. I thoroughly enjoyed his course on &lt;a href=&quot;https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-complete-node-js-course&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; development and I think he has a great way of teaching an explaining topics in a progressive and understandable way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wes Bos.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wesbos.com/&quot;&gt;Wes&lt;/a&gt; is an independent teacher/developer. As far as I know, he has not been on Udemy at all(similar to Todd Motto) and has built his audience completely from the ground up. I have been through his courses on JavaScript and CSS and listen to a his &lt;a href=&quot;https://syntax.fm&quot;&gt;Syntax&lt;/a&gt; podcast on a frequent basis. He is also mostly React based in his teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design+Code.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on the design side, but containing a lot of code too is &lt;a href=&quot;https://designcode.io&quot;&gt;Design+Code&lt;/a&gt; by Meng To. Meng has built up an independent site focused on teaching design (mostly through Sketch) as well as the coding of iOS app via Swift and React. The content is great! And for someone such as myself that now needs to design as well as code it has been a valuable resource to draw upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other platforms.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At various other stages, I have been on and used the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Treehouse.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com&quot;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; offers various courses on a large variety of topics. They tend to be more broad-based, so they cover all the building blocks through various teachers. They have a really cool platform, high quality, well-produced videos and good customer support. They were the first platform I signed up with, and if you are looking for variety, they are a great option. I do however, feel that the independent teachers mentioned above provide more in-depth, niche focused content, typically going hand-in-hand with deep dive course projects. Treehouse as mentioned is more, covering the basics on the high level than getting deep into the nitty-gritty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pluralsight.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com&quot;&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the mass-market choice, similar to Lynda/LinkedIn Training. They have a huge variety of topics and teachers, but I prefer to follow individual teachers and, similar to Treehouse, Pluralsight is more high-level, building-block type courses. There are few deep-dive courses that I have come across. In terms of Angular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/john-papa&quot;&gt;John Papa&lt;/a&gt; is a great teacher on the platform, I thoroughly recommend his content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lynda.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lynda.com&quot;&gt;Lynda&lt;/a&gt; is probably the oldest, most recognised player in online, video learning as they have been around forever. I used them for a while, but also found the content to be more broad-based, ticking the boxes type of content without the deep dives that really get into the details that developers have to navigate on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design Block.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Despite my renewed interest in design work, I have experienced some "design block" the past few days.

I have been working at design, but I was not making much progress. I kept at it, and in the end, what got me through, was working from another base. I took a UI design kit, found something that was along the lines of what I wanted and then started using it to apply my &lt;em&gt;failing&lt;/em&gt; designs to. I then started adapting my logo, colours and fonts to the new approach and I suddenly started making progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that, whenever you are stuck, it helps take a new approach. Rather than just sitting and spinning wheels. Think about other means by which you can get to where you need to be? Look for inspiration, look for designs, or pages that fit what you are looking for. Mix and match elements, colours, shapes and fonts to see if you get something you like. At minimum, you will get some new ideas and maximum, you will break through your barrier and make progress in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audible.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I first started using Audible in 2015.

Since then, I have completed listening to 42 titles amounting to a staggering 1 month, 1 day, 6 hours and 5 minutes of listening time to date. The vast majority of which was spent while commuting back and forth to work. In recent time, I have also started listening to Audible during &quot;in between time&quot;, such as while shaving, or changing, or washing the dishes. Things like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone who has not given listening to audiobooks I try, I heartily recommend it. Commuting and traffic sucks. The thing is though, while listening to audiobooks, especially good ones, the traffic and the frustration that might arise from it just melts away as you make your way through innumerable adventures and stories. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Expanding Your Comfort Zone.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since watching the incredible  Free Solo , a documentary about climber Alex Honnold's free solo ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite. Something…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0104/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0104/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since watching the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://www,nationalgeographic.com/films/free-solo&quot;&gt;Free Solo&lt;/a&gt;, a documentary about climber Alex Honnold&apos;s free solo ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite. Something Alex said has stuck with me. He said something along the lines of whenever he is climbing, he is continually working to expand his comfort zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase has been bouncing through my mind ever since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are familiar with the term &quot;getting out of your comfort zone&quot;. Especially after times of stagnation, or during times of change, people will often talk about getting out of their comfort zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical use case of the phrase &quot;getting out of your comfort zone&quot; tends to indicate someone is going to go and try something new and at some point thereafter, will likely return or arc back to the existing comfort zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I much prefer Alex&apos;s take on it, which I will take as: &quot;Continually working to expand your comfort zone&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intention.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continually&lt;/em&gt; indicates a mindset applied, held and refined over time. This is not an item on a list to tick-off on the weekend or on holiday and forget about. &lt;em&gt;Continually&lt;/em&gt; indicates the persistent application of mindset towards activity regardless of situation and context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Effort.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Working&lt;/em&gt; indicates that this is not easy. That it is an activity that takes considerable time and effort and presents ongoing challenges to perform and to improve. In context of Alex&apos;s activities, it is training. Training for a battle between life and death in the most literal sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expansion.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expansion&lt;/em&gt; is the part of the phrase I love. The words comfort zone indicate a delineated, fixed area. As we tend to get older, we increasingly trend toward the familiar and the known. Often, without realizing it, we adopt very fixed mindsets about what we can and cannot do, who we are and how we go about our lives. And we accept them. Expansion changes the perception of the term. Expansion is intentional, it is ongoing, it is bigger and indicates an ongoing level of change. It is dynamic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comfort Zone.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first start doing something, we often know next to nothing about it. We may have seen it, or decided we want to know more, but we can do very little. Every part of the activity or movement takes up a lot of effort and energy since we are confronting something new that our minds and bodies are not yet comfortable with or even capable of doing. Our mind is racing, our bodies tense and our hearts quite possibly in our throats or stomachs. As we improve, we grow accustomed, more relaxed and at ease while doing what we are doing. This is how we learn and progress. We become increasingly comfortable. It is a sign of progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, when you first learn something, you have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; comfort zone at all! Everything is new and uncomfortable. You have no safe space to retreat to. No gear at which you just cruise along. The comfort zone does not exist. Yet as soon as we become capable, as soon as we gain that ability, we have a safe space or comfort zone to retreat to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have become increasingly fond of the concept of &lt;em&gt;beginner&apos;s mind&lt;/em&gt;. That despite experience and knowledge, you need to (at least try) look at something with new eyes. To see a situation as it is, without the baggage of preconceived ideas and notions. Along with this, I want to add the concept of &quot;expanding the comfort zone&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expansion also represents departure. You are leaving your established zone, for new territory. If we take, for example, a conqueror in the past. The conqueror has to physically leave her existing territory for the new conquest. When she leaves, she cannot effectively claim that territory if she keeps retreating to what was previously held. Yes, she will need to govern or put structures in place to maintain what is there while she is away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux is that the new territory cannot be claimed via retreat. Yet this is often how we start to approach what we do. As soon as we get uncomfortable, or out of our depth, we make for retreat to the comfort zone. Yet this is not the way of progress. This is not how we learned in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the thing to remember is that all this discomfort, will not always be outside of your zone. The more you get uncomfortable, the more you expand, the larger your surface area of &apos;comfort&apos; will be. More importantly, the more comfortable you will be come with being uncomfortable in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Practice Incrementally.]]></title><description><![CDATA[For the past few weeks, I have been getting back into some long lost hobbies of mine.

Namely, wakeskating (like wakeboarding, but without the bindings and boots) and skateboarding. At my age, I likely have no business doing the latter, and even the former is proving harder than I remember it. The thing is, after a few weeks, I am starting to feel like it is starting to come back to me and starting to feel more comfortable. My arms and legs don&apos;t hurt as much, or get as stiff as they did before. My arms don&apos;t get as tired. The movements feel easier, more natural and I feel more confident trying new things. My mind is &lt;em&gt;racing&lt;/em&gt; less as I hit a feature.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being aware of the constraints of my age and not being in shape or attuned to the movements is, in a way, helping me improve. It is helping me build up a more solid base by slowly stepping up the things I try and the attempts I make instead of just going all in like I would have in the past. I seem to be taking a more &lt;em&gt;methodical&lt;/em&gt; approach. For example, once I learned boardslides again, I moved to boardlisde to fakie (backwards). Once those were comfortable, I decided to try do them switch (opposite stance). First to regular and then to switch. Those are now coming along as well. Similarly, now that I am getting comfortable on the boardslide, I am trying frontside boardlides (where you slide backwards). This felt like a big step for me since I have not done these before. Once one is comfortable doing a trick one way, you step it up to the opposite way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is practiciing incrementally. You do something, then as you start to get comfortable with it, you add a variation, or you do it backwards or the opposite way. Anything to switch it up or turn it around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakeskating is physically challenging. You fall a lot, and you have to swim a lot, but if you just keep at it, slowly but surely, you start getting better and I think this is how it goes with most of the things we do. Accept that you are going to fall a lot, that you are going to swim a lot and now and then going to get hurt. But rather than seeing each fall as a barrier to progress, see it as a stepping stone towards it. Each attempt is an experiment. A change of angle here, an adjustment of body position and speed there. Until eventually, you land the trick and ride away with a huge smile on your face.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thoughts on iOS/Material UI Elements and Sketch.]]></title><description><![CDATA[It has been slow-going since I started designing my app. Getting back up to speed with Sketch has gone well, however, getting up to speed…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0102/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0102/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been slow-going since I started designing my app. Getting back up to speed with Sketch has gone well, however, getting up to speed with the design paradigms and standards for iOS and Android design is taking longer. Despite using iOS on a daily basis, I am not yet dialled in on the naming conventions for the various UI controls, nor with the guidelines surrounding their usage. After so many years working on the web, I am having to learn the platform conventions. At least I am somewhat familiar with iOS. When it comes to Android, I am much less familiar. I have never owned an Android phone, so I am having to spend extra attention on what the possible differences might be between the platforms when it comes to layout and UI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I am enjoying the process! Considering that I have never worked in mobile, reviewed the HIG (Apple Human Interface Guidelines) and have scarce knowledge of Android and Material Design this is understandably taking longer than expected. I will need to keep this in mind for future estimates on the timing of my tasks and will need to allow for considerably more time for design tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iOS UI Elements.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Sketch workflow itself. Using symbols and text styles are great! Being able to make use of the Apple iOS UI Kit elements is really helpful. It is however, somewhat tricky at times, because you need to know the names of the elements in order to navigate the menus to find the correct items. The little thumbnails are so small that in order to check to see whether what you are looking at is actually what you want, you need to first add it to the artboard. Then, if it is not, you need to repeat the whole process again. It is not particularly intuitive. I also do not yet udnerstand what the difference is between &quot;Regular&quot; and &quot;Compact&quot; in the naming. Regular is far wider than an iPhone and Compact is narrower. So when it comes to Tab Bars, this makes little sense to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iOS Pickers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the elements for the Pickers are not well done. The pickers themselves seem to be flat symbols without text overrides. As such, if you want to edit the Date/Time pickers to be something custom you cannot. Fortunately, there are numerous online Sketch resources, but it seems odd that these symbols are not very comprehensive in this instance. As I understand it, pickers are effectively the iOS equivalent of dropdowns/select boxes on the web. As such, they are widely used, but yet the symbol for something so intrinsic is not well represented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iOS Library vs Material Templates.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementations of the different platforms (iOS and Android) are also a little odd. iOS UI elements can be used as &lt;em&gt;Library&lt;/em&gt; items. On one hand, you have easily accessible iOS UI symbols available via the &lt;em&gt;Insert&lt;/em&gt; menu. Yet, Material elements are templates. These need to be loaded in a separate template and then copied over to your working document. Come to think of it, I will need to find a Material Library resource. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Open Source for Design.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Sketch is paid for software, much of the ecosystem around it feels kind of like the open-sourcing of design in many respect. The ease at which one can find and re-used components created by other people is incredibly powerful and I believe is akin to open source if you squint at it. UI Kits are the equivalent, in some respects to libraries like Bootstrap or Foundation. Being able to share patterns, gradients, symbols etc are much like sharing components in code. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sketch Setup.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Now that I am getting going with Sketch again.

Below are some notes on my setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sketch Version.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had long since upgraded my version, as such, I bought a new license and upgraded to the latest version which is 53 (at the time of writing). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Source Control.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For source control, I decided to try out &lt;a href=&quot;https://versions.sympli.io/&quot;&gt;Versions by Sympli&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goabstract.com/&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the preferred tool, however, working as a solo designer, I do not feel the need to use this software just yet. After some investigation, I decided to give Versions a go since it is Git based and free to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some further investigation, I installed the following plugins to assist with workflow: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sketch Runner.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchrunner.com/&quot;&gt;Sketch Runner&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic plugin! It reminds me of CMD + P in VS Code or Spotlight on Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Craft by InVision.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long been a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/&quot;&gt;InVision&lt;/a&gt; for creating clickable prototypes (aka clickdummies), so it made sense to give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/craft&quot;&gt;Craft&lt;/a&gt; a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sketch Palettes.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes&quot;&gt;Sketch Palettes&lt;/a&gt; is a simple plugin to manage and import color palettes with support for colours, gradients and pattern fills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Content Generator.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timuric/Content-generator-sketch-plugin&quot;&gt;Content Generator&lt;/a&gt; has some overlap with Craft, but I like the simplicity of it. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Revisiting Design.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I used to work a lot in Photoshop, and in later years, I taught myself Sketch.

I did not used it heavily, but I was comfortable enough to get what I need done done. Now it has been some time since I used it, at least 2 years. Now that I am working on my own, I am having to revisit skills I long last used while working in a team. It is interesting, how the focus shifts quickly when your priorities and tasks change. Over the past few years, I have increasingly focused on development. I was involved in UX and design, but mostly with representing it in code, checking it matched the designs and with improving user experience and user flows where possible. I was not practicing the physical act of designing from scratch. Additionally, working with corporate identity means you are mostly putting together and re-arranging already-designed elements. It&apos;s a little more like Lego or Ikea. You have pre-fabricated blocks that you need to represent and put together according to existing rules. Creating new designs from scratch is something I have not done in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, designing for mobile means you need to take into account design practice as well as the Human Interface Guidelines, so you are not completely without guidance, but the act of creating from scratch is certainly more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am however, incredibly excited about it! Sketch is a great piece of software and I am looking forward to digging into both design and the software around it again. Admittedly, this will be a process. It is easy to think that you can just pick up where you left off years ago, but trade-offs are real. Spending years focusing on one set of skills, while not practicing or performing another means that you need to rewind, adopt a beginner&apos;s mind and approach the topic as if you are a novice to it. In many ways, you are, despite prior experience. Technology, software and the general practice and application of skills changes and evolves rapidly while you are doing other things! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, coincidentally, on the occassion of my 100th &apos;Today I Learned&apos; post, I looked forward to (re)learning new things and digging into design with fresh eyes and a fresh mind!

&lt;p&gt;Waking up this morning, I had two feelings. The voice in my head was much like a character in a film that trots out the old line: &quot;I have good news and bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s start with the bad I murmured to myself... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first feeling was fear. I had a sudden feeling of &quot;Shit! What have you done?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear that maybe I am just kidding myself and this is all just a fantasy. That several months down the line I would have &lt;em&gt;failed&lt;/em&gt; and that I would have to return, hat in hand, to getting a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Richard Feynman said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of that fear was structural. Having a job, a place to spend the day, where you have to be there at a certain and time and do certain things, provides a structure and motivation to your day that suddenly is not there in the form that I am accustomed to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I let that settle in though, I came to realise that such a fear is natural. It is what one does with that fear that ultimately decides whether we have failed or not. It is understandable to fear, as long as we face up to those fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I made my way through my new morning routine, I started to see my fear as a challenge. Fear will only take its hold if you do not act upon it and face up to it. With this type of fear, the best way of facing it is to do the important work of creating, of building. Step by step. As such, I decided to turn the fear into &lt;em&gt;resolve&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Excitement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second feeling was excitement. Excitement that, for the foreseeable future, I am working to build a new lifestyle. A lifestyle driven by purpose and creativity in both my work and in my life. To experiment and see whether I can find a balance different to the one I have been living for a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Progression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not where we find progression and purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the intersection of fear and excitement. If I think about doing something outdoors, like snowboarding or surfing, the attraction often involved an continuous cycle of fear and excitement. When trying something new,like hitting a jump, we have fear because we have not done the thing before. What if we fall? What if we hurt ourselves? Then once we have done it, we realise, it is not so bad after all and we try it again and again until we finally land the jump. At that point, there is a feeling of excitement and a sudden rush of adrenaline and purpose. Now that one has done it, you are on to the next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I land the jump again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If so, can I land it every time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I try a 180?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I do it switch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the options seem endless and, the cycle starts again. Maybe you fall, maybe you need to correct your stance? or your body position? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hard Work Begins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, fear and excitement, are only one part of the picture. The mental aspect. There is no progress without the physical. In the case of software development it is the process and habit of creation. The concept, the sketches, the design, the code, the flow. Unlike my previous job, the work does not end with the code and with the delivery. In order to make successful products, I will need to learn skills such as selling, marketing, managing feature priorities and needs. Who knows what else? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s get started! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Day One: Lessons.]]></title><description><![CDATA["Day One" is officially done.

I am mostly happy with how the day went, however, there are a few lessons I have learned: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep Your Laptop powered Up! (And other devices)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never know when load shedding or a busted power station will hit! (This is South Africa after all #eskom)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep it Lean.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your notes from The Lean Startup close, be mindful of activities that are valuable versus activities that are not. You need to figure out the right thing to build. That is, the thing customers want will pay for as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#Agile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep things #Agile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of tasks one needs to do as a maker are many. Listing them out in a backlog can start to feel a little intimidating when you list them all out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to manage this, estimate not only in effort but also in energy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Estimate in Effort &amp;#x26; Energy.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will help you when deciding on what to work on when and at what stage of the day. This will be a marathon and not a sprint and managing energy is likely just as, if not more important than managing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have set my estimates according to the following criteria: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Effort.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 = 1 - 2 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 = 3 - 5 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 = 6 - 8 hours (Need to break task down at this point)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 = 9 - 16 hours (You definitely need to break the task down now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13 = 17 - 32 hours (You&apos;re kidding right...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Energy.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H = High: The best time of the day, engaged and ready to go! (Reserved for most challenging tasks)
M = Medium: You are cruising along.
L = Low: You are tired, either physically of mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Make Friends With Notebooks, Whiteboards and Stickies.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should not be chained to the laptop or a digital device in order to do meaningful work. True, the product is digital, but the inspiration and concept exploration can be analog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper and whiteboard work can be immensely valuable. On the plus side, it can easily be thrown away, re-organised, re-arranged or redone because it is &lt;em&gt;quick and dirty&lt;/em&gt;. Far better to spend less time and cover more conceptual ground in the work earlier than to invest a lot of time into code or high fidelity designs only to run into corners and dead-ends that could have been uncovered just as easily through low fidelity work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, I bought myself the following:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whiteboard (+-1x0.5m) and some markers. (A local brand called Parrot from Game)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pile of sticky notes (Also from Game)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pile of notebooks (Technically, I did not buy all of these, many of them are repurposed from previous notes and have been gifts/handouts from various times.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Whiteboard.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whiteboard is to draw on, stick things onto and use as needed. It is immensely satisfying to be able to quickly write up and rub out ideas and thoughts. (Take photos if to refer back to later)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other great thing about a whiteboard is you can work at it standing up! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sticky Notes.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pile of sticky notes is to write out, add estimates, ideas, thoughts etc and to re-arrange as needed. The great thing about these is you can start to group, organise, annotate and general figure out in your head what can go there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing is, once they are done, you can take them down and pile them up if you need to refer to them later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Notebooks.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pile of notebookes is to write, write, write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use them for whatever you need! Sketches for screens, logos, thoughts, copy and anything else that might come up. You do not need to stay glued to a screen or another app to do these things. And better yet, you can change-up your scenery. You can write in notebooks from anywhere. (Yes, you can take your laptop anywhere, but its heavier and feels more &lt;em&gt;work-like&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the notebooks include, but are not limited to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Project Notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morning Journal/Notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority &amp;#x26; Todo Notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading Notes Notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[7 Lessons from 7 Years.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the years, I hope that I have learned a thing or two.

Work according to…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0097/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0097/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I hope that I have learned a thing or two. Mostly from making mistakes, and hopefully learning from them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Work according to values.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes: “If you don’t stand for something, you will fall for anything”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define your values and work according to them. Cutting corners on quality is like pulling out Jenga blocks - the tower keeps standing, but one block too many can bring the tower down.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The order of priorities matter.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priority is defined as: “the fact or condition of being regarded or treated as more important than others.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of priorities matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If delivery is first and quality second, think about what that means further on down the road. Buildings without solid foundations are shaky regardless of the layers of paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario and Zelda, once said: “A delayed game is eventually good. A rushed game is forever bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strong opinions, loosely held.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have opinions. Some right, some wrong, but mostly they are neither one nor the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold to the courage of your convictions. Make your case with vigour, however, don’t be so foolish so as not to listen to others and change your mind when appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Everyone has a voice, but not everyone decides.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In human groups, everyone has a voice and everyone should be heard. However, not everyone decides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are making decisions, listen to the viewpoints around you, weigh them up and make the decision. Be ready to motivate though. We don’t always all agree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You did not persuade me.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in IT, we often complain, grumble and lament that “business” or “management” does not get it. They do not understand, they do not see. No matter how many times we tell them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that telling is one thing. Persuading is another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Coding Horror explains, learn to persuade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trust.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with people all comes down to trust. If there is no trust, there are problems. And they will multiply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be trustworthy. Learn to trust others. Sometimes trust bites us, but not trusting at all will eventually bite harder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do what you say and say what you do. Speak with candour, provide criticism if required and make it constructive. We all know the problems, but once the venting is over, move towards solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Humans.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end though, it’s not about the brand, or the building, or the project. It is about the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all human beings, and in our own way doing the best we can with what we have. Stay humble and get creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As adults, we spend a large part of our lives with those we work with. You won’t get along with everyone, but you will meet people with whom you do. It is those people that make the day to day worthwhile and that I will miss the most. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Is It.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I started a newsletter!

In short, it is a subscription email newsletter/blog service that enables you to write and publish newsletters quickly, easily and charge for them (via Stripe) if you like. They are also busy experimenting with delivering podcasts too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The editor is clean and minimal - I like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no &quot;Saves as Draft&quot; button. Which is terribly weird and confusing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &quot;one line description&quot; of the site is not displayed - also confusing. (Maybe it appears if you upload a logo?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customisation options are limited, but considering this is a beta and MVP, understood. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there RSS feeds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The editor does not make it obvious how to add the various social media embeds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &apos;dark mode&apos; would be nice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is simple and staightforward. The look and feel reminds me of Medium to some extent, but this is not a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Support Service.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the last few days, I have had several interactions with 'support' services from various companies. The interaction with phone support…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0094/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0094/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days, I have had several interactions with &apos;support&apos; services from various companies. The interaction with phone support has been particularly bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some thoughts on this process: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call centres are terrible. The amount of time spent waiting on the line is, considering modern technology, unforgiveable. When it comes to &apos;support&apos; calls, especially for large financial institutions that compete on service and have sizable budgets, having a poor call centre experience is shameful. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my mind the following should happen: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a customer has been on the line longer than a certain period of time - provide an option to take a reference number and receive a call back within a specified time period (more on this below) so that the customer does not need to wait indefinitely on the line. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the above is not possible, at least, provide a number in the queue. Ideally the option for both. If the automated line can ask me to go through several automated/numbered prompts then they can provide this*. If am number 37 in the line, I will hang-up and try later or choose a call back. However, if I am number 3, I am happy to stay on the line. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Regarding &apos;Call Backs&apos;.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one particular interaction, I informed a consultant (via email) of what I required and was told a support consultant will contact me &apos;within 24 hours&apos; to assist me. This was a Friday, so within 24 hours includes a Saturday. Not my preferred day for &apos;waiting for phone calls&apos;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if a weekend was not involved, workdays involve meetings and discussions with people that may not be practical to be available for phone calls at random, unspecified times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the consultant then called the following day (a call I missed because I do not always keep my phone with me on weekends), saying &apos;they tried to contact me&apos; and said I must call the service number again. Basically, thanks for contacting us, but go through the whole rigmarole you just did again. Repeat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the email update of this scenario left me with a number to call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That number, when I called it, turned out NOT to be the number of someone who could help me. Instead it was a number of someone who did not have &apos;mandate&apos; to help me and passed me through to wait on the line again. This time, almost 3x times as long as I had originally. I eventually hung up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completely defeats the purpose of the service in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, there are two mistakes here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide the number of the line that can actually assist me. Instead of wasting my time once again. (Note: What I was attempting to do, was not enabled online via self-service, i.e. I could not achieve on my own in my own time.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are going to call &apos;within 24 hours&apos;, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the call is going to be made, send an email/sms to say, please expect the call within x minutes/hours. At least that way, there is some notice. Particularly because of the following: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, customers/consumers are inundated with unwanted and unwarranted sales calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these are &apos;automated&apos; sales calls. As in, an automated voice recording plays when you answer the phone. 99% of these calls are from unknown numbers. In many cases, the same institutions that already have your business, contract out support services to sell other services to their existing customers. As such, it is not uncommon to answer several calls a week only to say &quot;No I am not... no, thank you... excuse me... I am not intere...I am not... inte...&quot;. It is horrible. A waste of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a reasonable person may resolve &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to answer unknown numbers. The proliferation of apps designed specifically to identify unknown and call centre numbers such as Tru Caller have become commonplace. With that context, are companies honestly telling me that a support line is going to add their call, which the customer initiated, in the same hat as all the rest of the unwanted calls and expect us to be waiting patiently for their call? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly am not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect better. Better can be provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering many of these services accrue a long, almost lifetime value. Banks, financial institutions, mobile phone companies etc. Offering poor, shoddy service only tells me that I should consider going elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies clearly invest money in sending unwanted, promotional SMSes or automated phone calls which satisfy mostly their own needs. Yet these same companies invest or apply a similar approach when the customer actually wants service or assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days poor service is the norm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where every company is competing fiercely for attention, stellar service will stand head and shoulders above the rest. Good or excellent service will be spread via word of mouth and will pay for itself. Yet, most companies still trawl the same strategies, the same poor approaches as always leaving terrible customer experiences in their wake. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[GraphiQL.]]></title><description><![CDATA[GraphiQL (which you can pronounce as 'graphical') is the user interface for interacting with a GraphQL API.

It is more or less equivalent to Swagger UI for a REST API. It is useful in that you can first write your GraphQL queries on GraphiQL and experiment with them and once ready, you can then copy the queries and use them in your code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some basics: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, you will find the GraphiQL UI at, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8000/__graphql&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8000/__graphql&lt;/a&gt; (in the case of Gatsby.js) or, if you are running your own Apollo Server, you can define this and typically would place it at /graphql. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have written a query, you can execute it by pressing the &apos;Play&apos; button, or by hitting CMD + Enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have typed in a field in your query pane, you can CMD + Click on the field and it will open the appropriate documentation in the documentation pane on far right. You can then click on the relevant links in order to browse through the available fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When typing a query, you can press tab in order to make use of the auto-complete from the intellisense menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By clicking the &apos;History&apos; button up top, you can get a history of the all queries you have run and can click on them to execute them again or you can modify them if you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using queries that take parameters, you can clikc on the &quot;Query Variables&quot; button at bottom left and it will open a pane when you can assign your query variables via JSON syntax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphiQL is an invaluable tool when working with a GraphQL API. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dotenv.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Environment variables are an important part of any codebase.

I have found using &lt;code&gt;dotenv&lt;/code&gt; to be particularly useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively, you would use environment variables anywhere you make use of environment specific config in your code. Typically, this is not something you want to reveal. Node.js is then able to access these environment variables via the process.env object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i dotenv&lt;/code&gt; // to install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following to your .gitignore file. (You do not want to store your valuable usernames, details etc in your code repo): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.env &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say you wanted to specify your port number, in your .env file you will then add: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORT=3000
HOST=yourhostnamehere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you are ready to roll - in the relevant Node.js file add: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require(&apos;dotenv&apos;).config();

...

const PORT = process.env.PORT;
const HOST = process.env.HOST;

...

server.listen(PORT, () =&gt; {
  console.info(`Server listening on port: ${PORT}...`);
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were hosting your application on an Azure App Service for example, you would navigate to your App Service in the Azure Portal. From there select the &quot;Application Settings&quot; blade and then in your App Settings, you would create fields named as you have them in your .env file. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Little Coloured Circles.]]></title><description><![CDATA[It suprising to me how effective the little coloured circles are on the Activity Tracker on the Apple Watch.

Ever since I bought the Apple Watch in December last year, I have been making sure to keep up with my activity goals by completing the Exercise, Stand and Move circles every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find collecting the circles and maintaining the streak strangely satisfying. It is easy to miss days of activity when you don&apos;t see the gaps in your progress. Without the visual reminder, it is far too easy to let one day merge into three days, which in turn can easily merge into a week and pretty soon you are a few weeks into a slump in activity without realising how long it has been.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, it can be tiresome on days where you don&apos;t feel the energy or desire to exercise, but more often than not, that annoying reminder or the incomplete circle is enough to get you on your feet and out the door!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Remotivate.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some of the times the thoughts, ideas and lessons come easily and you can write about them.

At others they don&apos;t. Leaving work today, I was pretty demotivated. The project I am working on is challenging, but it was not that what got me down, it was the fact that it seems like the team as a whole is increasingly resigned to the state of the project. Like it is becoming accepted that things are tough and that&apos;s just how it will be and we have to live with it. It seems to me the focus is more on problems than solutions, and that&apos;s not a corner one wants to take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I have recently been going wakeskating again. For those who don&apos;t know, wakeskating is like wakeboarding, just without the bindings. And the lesson for today, if there is one, is that no matter how demotivated you might feel, going out and doing something you enjoy straight after that is the best remedy. Focus on something else and the problems will lose their edge and your mind and body will soon return to a place where the solutions take priority over the problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Thing.]]></title><description><![CDATA[When it comes to habits or routines, my feeling is it is best to do what you need to do first thing!

&lt;p&gt;First thing might mean first thing in the morning, or first thing after work, or first thing before you settle down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever way it goes, first thing is best. That way you don&apos;t give yourself any time for excuses or second guessing. That way, if worst comes to worst, you get the thing done and out of the way so you can move on to whatever else it is you may want to do. Either way, you get the thing you want done and dusted. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Insomnia, cURL and JSON Path.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have been a fan and user of the  Insomnia REST Client  for quite some time.

Initially, I was a regular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getpostman.com/&quot;&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; user, but when Postman switched from being a Chrome browser extension to a standalone app, their proxy user authentication and support was not great. (If I understand correctly, Postman used to piggyback on Chrome&apos;s proxy auth - which worked great!) As a result, and after much GitHub issue browsing, I just could not (and still cannot) get Postman to work through the corporate proxy at work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case though, one door closing leads to another door opening and I am so glad it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insomnia is great! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the UI, I love the name (Finally, a REST client you&apos;ll &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;) and I love that Insomnia has actually taught me a few things I did not know, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;cURL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll admit, cURL was a little obscure to me (still is). However, ever since discovering that Insomnia allows you to quickly and easily recreate API calls by pasting the cURL into the address bar, I have become a regular user. (Special tip: When viewing the Resquest pane in your dev tools, right click on the request you are interested in and then select &lt;code&gt;Copy as cURL&lt;/code&gt;. Then paste it into the Insomnia address bar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above, combined with my increased usage of Node.js, which has me spending more time in the terminal than ever before, and I have started to use cURL to test basic GET commands instead of Insomnia! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: This is only for basic GET commands, for more complex calls, I still find Insomnia far quicker and easier to setup a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;JSON Path&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am working on a project which has some APIs which return quite a lot of data. When interrogating the data for possible bugs and root causes, I work in Insomnia or transfer browser calls to Insomnia for the following reasons: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing both request and response in one pane far surpasses having to switch between panes in the browser dev tools. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to quickly change values and re-submit API requests far surpasses having to redo actions in the browser. (Or type out cURL commands)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Again) The UI &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; surpasses what appears in the browser. (I love dark modes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to screenshot or share cURLs is far easier in Insomnia than it is from the browser. (But only by a little...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is a 5th point to that list: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/&quot;&gt;JSON Path&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, somewhat frustratedly, scrolling up and down through the response pane and minimising/maximising objects and arrays to get a better sense of the large data sets I was receiving, I noticed the small input bar at the very bottom right of the screen. When clicking the little &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; icon at the end the line, I discovered this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Use JSON Path to filter the response body. Here are some examples you might use on a book store API.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$.store.books[*].title&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$.store.books[?(@.price &amp;#x3C; 10)].title&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$.store.books[-1:]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$.store.books.length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; what I was looking for! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using JSON Path makes it so much easier to get a sense of the overall shape and quality of the data you are getting back than scanning it manually. You can very efficiently narrow down the data to particular areas of focus, with an almost JSON like query language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me, that, often times, the best software or technology, not only finds a useful place in your workflow, but also teaches or reveals things to you that you were not aware of before. I exceptional cases, the software teaches you things that are really, incredibly useful! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature request: Smart auto-complete for JSON Path queries based on the data you have received.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Continuing Microservices.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last week I started working towards building a basic microservice in Node.js.

I have been following along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-microservices-for-beginners/&quot;&gt;Node.js Microservices for Beginners&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy and I have enjoyed it thoroughly! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the course is a little rough around the edges in terms of presentation, the content is interesting and engaging from multiple perspectives as it takes you through building the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A GraphQL server using Apollo. (Writing queries, mutations and resolvers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A basic REST API with MongoDB (the course uses mLab but I used my own local MongoDB instance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing your services with PM2. (And how to use the terminal to monitor your services)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing messages to RabbitMQ hosted on CloudAMQP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sending email via Mailjet (Not yet watched and coded).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have worked with GraphQL on this very website, but beyond the initial implementation of this site, I am not very familiar with this technology. This course has given me a good grounding and I am certainly keen to dig deeper on the topic in future! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REST APIs with Mongo is not new to me since I have been working with this stack for quite some time. However, it was great to see how to combine a Gateway GraphQL API in front, with a REST API behind it. This definitely opens up doors of possibility in decoupling the apps and services I build in future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the upcoming MailJet portion of the course will be interestring - what I am particularly excited about is the implementation of the queue! While I have implemented my own email sending service via Nodemailer using Handlebars for templating, I am really excited about using a queue to sit in between the mailing service and the API. Using the architecture and setup I am learning in this course will give me plenty of confidence to refactor such an implementation into a more modern and scalable setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, you learn and do something in development which makes you feel like you are entering a new phase of ability - being able to implement and use a microservices with a queue/message based system definitely feels like a step in that direction for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt;
While the course uses CloudAMQP for the RabitMQ implementation and MailJet for sending emails, I will be looking to expand upon this by setting up my own RabbitMQ server as well as using NodeMailer to send the emails. Cloud services are fantastic! For production purposes they are the better option, however, for the process of learning and building that foundational knowledge, I feel it makes sense to do the work to set up one&apos;s own instance for the experience. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[PM2 Commands.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here are some PM2 commands:  pm2 start ecosystem.config.js pm2 stop all pm2 delete all pm2 show id-of-process pm2 env 0   pm2 log pm2 monit…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0086/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0086/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here are some PM2 commands: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pm2 start ecosystem.config.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pm2 stop all&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pm2 delete all&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pm2 show id-of-process&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pm2 env 0&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pm2 log&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pm2 monit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;dotenv&lt;/code&gt; with PM2 and Lerna, keep in mind that PM2 will be looking in your root for its environment variables, as such, you will need to set your .env variables in the root. This meant I need to update the naming I used in my services to things such as &lt;code&gt;GATEWAY_PORT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DB_PORT&lt;/code&gt; as opposed to just PORT in the separate packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitioning to PM2 from a simple nodemon setup takes some getting used to and means you need to get comfortable with viewing and navigating output and error log files. You will find these in your user folder under .pm2/logs. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Seeing the Positives.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Working on difficult, unstable projects can be demotivating.

When builds break unexpectedly and the codebase seems to reveal new, unexpected bugs today where yesterday there were none it can be challenging to remain positive. It is however, during times like these that we can learn from our mistakes and learn new skills. Instead of grumbling and complaining, it serves a good opportunity to ask why these things are happening and to think through what you are seeing and ask why? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What error messages are you seeing? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are they originating? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the patterns? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sanity check your assumptions, your inputs and outputs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you start digging into these questions, you will soon find there is much to learn and dig into and instead of getting demotivated, you can start to see motivation in starting to discover what is not understood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bug Reporting.]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the teams I work in, I expect the follwing when it comes to bug reporting:  Clear description of the bug Clear, defined steps to…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0084/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0084/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the teams I work in, I expect the follwing when it comes to bug reporting: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear description of the bug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear, defined steps to reproduce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relevant url, browser and related info which could be, but not limited to entry details, screenshots, categories of user, brand or configuration which has impact. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I will provide once I have investigated the bug: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brief description of replication steps and process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relevant findings and further information for future reference. (Or confirmation if something is not clear)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description of resolution or next steps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once complete, a resolution/confirmation of closure. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above should all be commented on or provided on the bug report, be it in ALM or Jira, so that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who wants to know the status can see what has been done, what has been found and what state the bug is in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone should be able to pick up where you left and retrace your steps/line of thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are sharing your knowledge - several days, weeks or months down the line, you cannot rely on yourself (or anyone else) to accurately &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; exactly what happened when and how. The detail does not need to be exhaustive but it must be descriptive enough to ignite your recollection or to orient someone else. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like documentation, good bug history and knowledge needs to be built up over time. DRY (Don&apos;t repeat yourself) does not only apply to the code you write, but also to your personal as well as your team&apos;s collective knowledge and memory of what has gone wrong, what mistakes were made on how these can be improved upon in future. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Progression.]]></title><description><![CDATA[The feeling of progress can be elusive in development.

Many days it may feel as if you are sitting and banging your head against something, not making much &lt;em&gt;visible&lt;/em&gt; progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have not submitted a significant pull request in a while because you changed your mind on an implementation, or you discovered a bug you can&apos;t quite get your head around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, it may feel as though you are not making progress. As frustrating as this might feel, do not let it discourage you!
It is during these times in which we perceive a lack of progress in which we are silently, subtly, doing the hard work of progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to pay attention to notice the signs - personally, there were a few small moments during the past few days where I felt like I was seeing progress despite being somewhat bogged down in figuring out the flow of a challenging project I am working on: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I noticed some peculiarities in the flow of data through some AngularJs components I was working on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote new functions using ES6 features instead of old ES5 habits, not necessarily deliberately, but because, recently, it just &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; more natural that way.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I re-organised some Node.js code I had written far more quickly and easily than I expected to. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I refactored some code originating from older dependencies according to breaking changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These may seem like insignificant moments, however in my view, these moments signify progression. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Starting Microservices.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Microservices are certainly a hot development topic at present.

One of my current projects is in early planning stages for moving from one large monolith with many developers to many small microservices with the many developers split up into dedicated teams focusing on microservices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I understand the concept of microservices in theory and have done some reading on the topic, I have never actually built or worked on an application with such an architecture. To date, every app I have worked on has been a single deployment monolith. Granted, on one of my primary projects, I started work in the direction of microservices by splitting out functionality into separate smaller apps, but due to inexperience and a lack of knowledge on the topic, it is not a true microservices architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I have started delving into the world of Node.js microservices and I am really excited about the possibilities! It feels like I am really starting to level-up my skills and taking another step towards becoming a better developer in an exciting area of modern development!  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lodash Notes.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Lodash  is a great utility library for working with data in JavaScript.

Combined ES6 functionality, Lodash really helps in making your code simpler and easier to read. It does add a dependency, but my feeling is that the efficiency and effectivness of using it makes up for the time and effort one would spend implementing similar functionality on your own. Of course, writing custom functions will help you learn and improve your coding ability, one needs to evaluate the pros and cons of your particular context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few useful Lodash notes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installation: &lt;code&gt;npm i lodash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js usage: &lt;code&gt;const _ = require(&apos;lodash&apos;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React usage: &lt;code&gt;import _ from &apos;lodash&apos;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful Lodash functions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_.pick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var object = { &apos;a&apos;: 1, &apos;b&apos;: &apos;2&apos;, &apos;c&apos;: 3 };
_.pick(object, [&apos;a&apos;, &apos;c&apos;]);
// { &apos;a&apos;: 1, &apos;c&apos;: 3 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_.pickBy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var object = { &apos;a&apos;: 1, &apos;b&apos;: &apos;2&apos;, &apos;c&apos;: 3 }; 
_.pickBy(object, 1);
// { &apos;a&apos;: 1 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_.includes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_.includes([1, 2, 3], 1);
// true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_.debounce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_.debounce(yourFunctionHere, 500)
// executes function after 500ms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_.without&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_.without([2, 1, 4, 3], 1, 2);
// [4, 3]

Over the years, it has started to become one of my favourite reads and I look forward to his posts on a daily basis. His recent post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://avc.com/2019/01/capitalism-and-inequality/&quot;&gt;Capitalism and Inequality&lt;/a&gt;, stuck with me for different reasons than usual though. It succeeded as a thought provoking piece, but I felt it missed the mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, take the remarkable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yedfKGZ7do&quot;&gt;closing credits&lt;/a&gt; of the 2010 comedy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386588/&quot;&gt;The Other Guys&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, the animation that records the exponentially growing salary ratio of CEO to average employee: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1921, the credits list the ratio as 9:1. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 2010 the ratio was 319:1. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the average CEO salary has multiplied over 35 times between 1921 - 2010, how many times has the average employee&apos;s salary multiplied? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives* have within their immediate power, the ability to address the inequality of that 319-1 pay ratio. The inability or unwillingness to do so is immoral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;I use the term &apos;executives&apos; to represent &lt;code&gt;those with power&lt;/code&gt;. They could be founders, CEOs, C-level executives, board members, investors or similar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Documentation.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Documentation has a bad reputation amongst developers.

This needs to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think &quot;documentation&quot; means a Word document attached to an email get your head out of the sand. If all the project knowledge, is sitting in your head you have neglected an important aspect of your job. To teach people. To leave your project or codebase better than you found it. At worst - if a truck hits you tomorrow, does everything you know disappear with you, leaving others to scramble in your absence? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, that sounds morbid, but we are here to do the best work we can. That means showing up every day, and at minimum trying to learn something. It also means showing and teaching others. This may mean sitting with someone to help them setup a project, or explain the bigger project picture. Better yet, it means sitting down and writing up a blog post or Markdown file that another human can understand so that they can set it up themselves in their own time. (Teach a person to fish...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at GitHub or any library or framework worth its own salt and you will find documentation. Not only on the GitHub page, but on the NPM page and on the website and in issues, PRs and Stack Overflow answers. At minimum, it should be written up in a readme or Markdown file. A few weeks ago I went through the basic React Tutorial on the React site. It was written by Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux. If you think clear, concise and thoughtful documentation is beneath you, think again! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email is where information and knowledge go to die. Don&apos;t send emails with instructions and steps - send emails with links to your blog posts. People often like to roll the old &quot;work smart, not hard&quot; adage out, yet they sit and re-type emails with the same information and instructions in them day in and day out and get frustrated with people asking them questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, documentation does not mean a .docx file. It can mean any or all of the following including but not limited to blog posts, readme files, markdown files, Confluence pages, code comments. If you don&apos;t like Confluence, that&apos;s cool! Come up with something else, but make it findable and shareable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation does not need to be boring either! Add some personality, add some humour (if its appropriate and if you can pull it off), make it your own. Just make sure that you make it! None of the options are perfect, and not everyone likes to write, but unless you can explain something to someone else in a way that they can understand it, the question hanging over your own head should be whether you truly understand it yourself? &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Give it a Shot.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Development is not easy.

Sometimes you get stuck. Sometimes you miss things which later seem obvious. Sometimes you need that Github Gist or Stack Overflow answer to get you over the hump. Sometimes you need to read a blog post, or tutorial or watch an online video or course to teach you. Sometimes all of the above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding does not &lt;em&gt;come naturally&lt;/em&gt; for everyone or even anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes with curiosity, attention, perseverence and questioning. You learn by doing. And you learn better by doing it over again. By asking questions. And trying things that do not work. It certainly does not come by not trying, by not taking a shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I often try to remember with coding is that you need to start small. Start with the smallest thing possible: put something on the screen, even if you need to hardcode it. Log something to the console. Check the basics, take the small steps. Reference &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;. Read. The. Code. Think it through. Ask yourself what the code is doing and then ask yourself, if it is really doing what you think it is doing. (If so why or why not?)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, do not just give up! Sure, you may find tasks you cannot do and you might (often) find you get horribly stuck and keep bashing your head against the same thing over and over. When you think you really cannot do it. Then &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubberduckdebugging.com/&quot;&gt;rubber duck debug it&lt;/a&gt;. If you still cannot get there. Then ask for help. There are many friends and colleagues more than willing to help. Just don&apos;t give up before you have even tried and definitely, do not try to pawn the work off to someone else before taking the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pass up on trying, not only do you pass the buck to someone else, but you also forfeit your chance to learn something valuable. You give up on an opportunity to grow and to figure something out for yourself. Development is an endless series of small steps. Learning is an endless series of questions. Even if you do not get it right and end up having to ask for help, that is good. If someone else needs to help you, there is no shame in that, but if they help you and you have not tried, what will you really learn? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the task will be done, but someone else would have done it and what progress would you have made? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, make it your best shot! Anything short of that and you are letting yourself down. You will often be surprised by what you will learn. Anything short of a solid attempt, and chances are that next time, you will pass on taking the shot again. And again...&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[IntelliJ Tips.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have worked with various text editors throughout my career.

I started out using Macromedia Dreamweaver, then moved onto Sublime Text and had a brief fling with Atomic before moving to Visual Studio Code. At work however, I often need to work in a Java IDE. For the first few years this meant NetBeans, however, over the past year it has meant IntelliJ IDEA. As such, I currently need to switch between VS Code and IntelliJ regularly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I use both on Windows and Mac, so it makes for a somewhat confusing scenario when it comes to keyboard shortcuts and menu options. The context switching can be a little annoying. Especially if you have spent a few days in one, only to switch over to the other and find that you don&apos;t even know the basic shortcuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to improve my workflows on these editors, here are some IntelliJ tips: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Settings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Settings panel in IntelliJ plays a big part in your development experience on IntelliJ, as such, it helps to get familiar with it. Hit &lt;code&gt;CMD + ,&lt;/code&gt; to open the Settings panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can do things such as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup External Tools to run .bat files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup (and learn) Live Templates (which are code snippets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup File Watchers to run &lt;a href=&quot;https://prettier.io/&quot;&gt;Prettier&lt;/a&gt; on save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install and manage Plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;Simple React Snippets&lt;/code&gt; from VS Code is not available on IntelliJ IDEA. I have seen that there are several React snippet plugins in addition to the built-in &apos;Live Templates&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some useful shorcuts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Alt + Shift up/down&lt;/code&gt; to move lines up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Double Shift&lt;/code&gt; to search everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Alt + Shift + F&lt;/code&gt; to search in file path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CMD + F&lt;/code&gt; to search within a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + CMD + G&lt;/code&gt; to find all occurences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + V&lt;/code&gt; to open the VCS/Git panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emmets is built-in, so this is great! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I have noticed with IntelliJ is that, while it is a lot more integrated in so many ways. It is just that little bit slower than VS Code for most operations. This makes sense, but it is noticeable. For example, using Prettier on save with VS Code is practically instant. One IntelliJ it takes just that heartbeat longer. At first, I was not sure if it was working or not. &lt;/p&gt;

Oftentimes, this means setting up Java projects eventhough you only need to work on the front-end. This type of setup may involve, but not be limited to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up Java&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up Maven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up Payara&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up Postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running batch commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running SQL scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing SSL certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring proxy settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing tasks like this can sometimes be frustrating, especially when local builds fail due to obscure reasons that you don&apos;t fully comprehend. Below are some random throughts on this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using Maven, check that your settings.xml file is correctly configured - typically found in &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\username\.m2&lt;/code&gt;. Make sure to check for things such as usernames &amp;#x26; passwords are correct, proxy settings are what they should be. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;java -version&lt;/code&gt; in your terminal and get an unrecognised command message, it means that you JAVA_HOME environment variable is not setup correctly, and you will need to run java commands and keytool from the folder where you java.exe is located. Rather than having to do that, ensure you env variable is setup correctly! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure your .npmrc file is correctly configured, either with your npm-registry or nexus repository locations or your http.proxy settings. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are using Nexus, make sure the npm modules are in the repository. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the necessary SSL certificates are present in your keystore, these may need to be in your JRE lib/security/cacerts or in your Payara keystore. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using Postgres, ensure that your local database names, usernames and passwords are correct. Additionally, make sure that your usernames have the correct roles. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have run the necessary scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have run the necessary terminal commands. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Enterprise applications, you will often need to use IntelliJ plugins such as CheckStyle, FindBugs and SonarLint, make sure that you have setup the necessary .xml files for these to reference. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, all of the necessary steps will be laid out in Confluence (or similar) to assist with the necessary setups. If not, ask your fellow developers for some assistance, and in the process, make notes that you can refer back to and then re-trace your steps and re-write the steps into a how-to article that you can contribute to the team and project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you may not be a Java developer, it often takes a non-Java developer to write out an article, in plain, understandable, step-by-step language that other developers can follow! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Binary Trees: Part 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have been avoiding this.

Ever since I first encountered the binary tree in the Daily Coding Problems, I have been procrastinating on this topic. If ever my impostor syndrome regarding my abilities or designation as a &apos;programmer&apos; had effect it is in situations like this. But, I can&apos;t avoid it forever, and you every journey starts with one step, so here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Binary Trees&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A binary tree is a data structure that has at most, two children. Since a binary tree can only have at most 2 children, we name them left or right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically trees are used to store hierarchical information - ie. files in a computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate hierarchical data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make information easy to search (tree traversal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate sorted lists of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-stage decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Router algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Attributes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moderate access/search (quicker than linked list, slower than arrays)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than arrays, slower than unordered linked lists)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trees don’t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Properties&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A node on a tree contains the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pointer to the left child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pointer to the right child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Terms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A node with no parent is the root node. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A node with no children is called a leaf. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the most basic definition of a node in a binary tree: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Node {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }

    // Todo
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Components&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating components, &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the component first before implementing it. That is to say, use the planned component in the parent before you have coded it so you can think about the interface before implementing the code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating components, give props generic names so that you do not tightly bind the name of props to the type of the data in the current implementation. Chances are good that when you look to re-use the component with another data source or context, the name of your prop may no longer suit. In cases, whe you are not certain what the props data names might be, you can pass props that specify the name of the field to be read, then in the component, you can use &lt;code&gt;item[value]&lt;/code&gt; square bracket notation for object properties as opposed to &lt;code&gt;item.value&lt;/code&gt; dot notation for properties. This makes your components more generic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Default Props&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set default props if you think most components or data that will be used will use the same property names. For example: &lt;code&gt;_id&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;. You can use default props as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ComponentName.defaultProps = {
    valueProperty: “_id”,
    textProperty: “name”,
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will enable you to pass the necessary props only when they will differ from the default props. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Event Bubbling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that when you do something like this when bubbling an onClick event: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3C;ComponentList
    items={this.state.items}
    currentItem={this.state.currentItem}
    onClick={item =&gt; this.handleItemSelection(item)}
/&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;handleItemSelection(item) {
    ... do something ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can achieve the same thing like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3C;ItemsList
    items={this.state.items}
    currentItem={this.state.currentItem}
    onClick={this.handleItemSelection}
/&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a function like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;handleItemSelection = item =&gt; {
    ... do something ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Object Destructuring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are often referencing this.props in your component, it helps to use object destructuring to simplify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a class component, within the &lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; method, but before the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement, you can do the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const { onClick, currentGenre, genres } = this.props;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, where you would have used, for example: &lt;code&gt;this.props.onClick&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;this.props.currentItem&lt;/code&gt;, you can instead use &lt;code&gt;onClick&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;currentItem&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using a function component, you will enter the same object destructuring code within the component function, and before the return statement. For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const ItemList = props =&gt; {
    const { items, textProperty, valueProperty, onItemSelect } = props;
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arrays in JavaScript.]]></title><description><![CDATA[The past few years, working with JavaScript, the for loop was the go-to tool I used for iterating and working on collections.

Over the last few months, as I have adopted more modern JavaScript and TypeScript, the functions below have started to become a daily part of my development habits: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Array.map&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map&quot;&gt;Array.map&lt;/a&gt; lets you iterate over an array and it will return a new array, as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const result = array.map(item =&gt; { ... do something making use of each item...});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s great about this is that it does not mutate the original array. Additionally, you can added second parameter to get the index of the item, like so: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const result = array.map((item, index) =&gt; {
    ... do something making use of item and index
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Array.filter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter&quot;&gt;Array.filter&lt;/a&gt;, similarly, lets you iterate over an array, using a conditional to &lt;em&gt;filter&lt;/em&gt; the array according to some criteria: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const filteredResult = array.filter(item =&gt; ... check against some condition... );&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, you can get a hold of the index by passing a second parameter like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const filteredResult = array.filter((item, index) =&gt; ... check against some condition... );&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Array.slice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is not so new, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice&quot;&gt;Array.slice&lt;/a&gt; is useful since it returns a copy and does not mutate the original: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const slicedResults = array.slice(startIndex, endIndex); // end index is *not* included&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also achieve a similar result as above by using lodash like so: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import _ from &apos;lodash&apos;

const result = _(array).slice(startIndex).take(numOfItems).value();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another very useful function is &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce&quot;&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/a&gt;. What this does is that it &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; the array to a single value by performing some computation on the items. It take two parameters, an accumulator and the value. Note, if you need to check against some condition, you will first need to filter your array on the condition and then chain the reduce onto that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const result = array.filter(item =&gt; ... do some check against a condition ...).reduce((accumulator, value)) =&gt; {... do some calculation...});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above are so much simpler to work with than for loops once you get a hold of them!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Markdown.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have become a big fan of Markdown!

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s the de-facto standard for readme files, and having spent a considerable amount of time working in Git and becoming accustomed to Git and GitHub conventions, Markdown has become a daily part of life. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This blog itself is powered by Markdown, and of late, I have been writing to it daily which has lead to me becoming increasingy accustomed to the conventions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I have gotten more familiar with Markdown, it has started to find its way into my commit messages, pull request comments and much else besides since BitBucket, Confluence, GitHub and Azure Devops all support Markdown. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a longtime reader of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; by John Gruber, the creator of Markdown, I like the fact that I have finally become a regular user of Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love the name! &lt;/li&gt;

It is likely due to the fact that, while learning the Git basics, I followed the online Git tutorial and that stuck, regardless, these are some Git commands I use often: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git branch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git fetch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -m &quot;Type message here&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git log -3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote -v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote add origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote remove remoteName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout branchName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone repoUrlGoesHere&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I first need to learn more about binary trees before attempting problem #3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem is not presented in JavaScript, so I will need to understand the code better before attempting problem #3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Problem #4.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I proceeded to #4 and managed to finish this problem in 38 mins, which is certainly an improvement! Regardless of time, what improved was my approach to the problem. I was very conscious of doing the following in my implementation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow down, think/talk the problem through first to make sure you understand it. (Illustrate your understanding of the problem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write tests of the examples first, then add a few extra tests based on your understanding of the problem. (Confirm that you understand the problem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write out your solution in comments/psuedo code before writing actual code to try and get a better grasp of the nature of the problem. (Illustrate how you plan to solve the problem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the code in baby steps, make sure you get the obvious results first. (Show how you actually break things down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break the steps into separate functions if you need to. (Show that you are able to think atomically and evolve your thinking as you go)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this problem was likely easier than #3, it was more or less on par with #1 and #2 so I feel that I have certainly learned something through this process so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I have had to refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt; at times, which I would not be able to do in a real test situation. Today, I revisited &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort&quot;&gt;.sort&lt;/a&gt;. I have used .sort before, but I needed to refer to the docs to refresh my memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, .sort takes a callback function which you use to compare items to each other. Sort will convert to string and you need to evaluate whether one is before or after the other. That is to say: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return 1 if a comes before b&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return -1 if a comes after b&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return 0 if a and b are equal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Having understood the problem, it easy to refactor the solutions using more modern ES6 constructs such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter&quot;&gt;.filter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce&quot;&gt;.reduce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map&quot;&gt;.map&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lessons Learned.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have a solution, it becomes easier to reason about improvements if you have an idea of what avenues you have for improvement. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests really help you find bugs in your code! (During the refactor, after my first pass I thought I had a successful refactor, but a failing test showed me that I had a flaw in my reasoning!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to step through your failing code step by step to understand where and why you are going wrong! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot use a conditional inside of .reduce, you first need to .filter your set on the condition you have in mind and then .reduce from there. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Possible Improvement.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine the two functions into a more succinct solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things considered, I still feel a long way off from being half-way decent at algorithms, but I am making progress, no matter how &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nicholaspretorius/dcp/blob/master/solutions/dcp02.js&quot;&gt;small the steps&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mo' Coding Problems.]]></title><description><![CDATA[In my  previous post , I said that "I feel that algorithms and mathematical-type programming is something I need to improve on".

That was an understatement. I am terrible at them! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As evidenced by my struggle with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nicholaspretorius/dcp/blob/master/solutions/dcp02.test.js&quot;&gt;2nd problem&lt;/a&gt;! (And these are the &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; ones!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never has the term &lt;em&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/em&gt; felt so appropriate... :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lessons Learned.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who wants to read that sob story! Rather, let&apos;s take a look at what I learned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote my tests first! Before I attempted solving the problem I wrote tests for the solution, so at least I could prove it worked or not!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got ahead of myself in the coding - I started out thinking about what new ES6 feature I would use before effectively thinking through the problem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with the most obvious part of the problem - even if it is not the solution! (As with much development, start small and get the obvious results first before leaping to solutions... move in increments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: The most obvious thing to do is to forget about excluding the one number in the multiplication and make sure you first get the products of all the numbers multiplied. From there, it is then far easier to focus on &lt;em&gt;excluding&lt;/em&gt; the one number from that point than it is to get tangled up in a misguided attempt at solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawing out a sketch of the idea for your solution helps you have a basis from which to work from and to which to go back to when you get caught up in going wrong. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get beyond embarrassment - I am embarrased that I struggled with this, the solution was so obvious once I got it (I am not sure if it was a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; one - but it passed the tests.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Possible Improvements.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I found a solution, it is time to consider some improvements: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could use .reduce for the multiply function rather than a loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With .reduce, I could combine move that functionality into one function rather than
two. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could look into using .map instead of a for loop. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, I found a solution just as I was thinking I should step away and take a breather. Additionally, I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended&quot;&gt;jest-extended&lt;/a&gt; which is a collection of useful and convenient assertions. Specifically I used .toIncludeSameMembers to ensure the outputted array matched the expectation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I took a read through problem #3 and I feel more impostor-like than ever! I know on a &lt;em&gt;surface&lt;/em&gt; level what a binary tree is but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: I refactored my solution according to my suggestions, you can find my comments &lt;a href=&quot;/til0068/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Daily Coding Problems.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I recently subscribed to the  Daily Coding Problems  email newsletter.

As they put it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get exceptionally good at coding interviews by solving one problem every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I am not planning on interviewing any time soon, however, I feel that algorithms and mathematical-type programming is something I need to improve on. As a result, I thought it would be a good idea to take up the challenge! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the get go, I am a little behind. I have already received 7 emails, but I only go to doing the first one today. So much for New Year&apos;s Resolutions! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liken these coding problems to fitness drills in sport - while a sportsman or woman may be fit and be good at the sport they play without specific fitness drills of training. Chances are very good that their overall game will be much improved by doing specific drills and training that focus on individual elements of their game. This is my development version of the daily jog or push-ups. Short, limited exercises that don&apos;t take too much time, but are focused and when done repeatedly will lead to health and strength improvements! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tests.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this exercise, I am also including tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests are &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; to modern development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests provide an easy way to run the code. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to get more familiar with writing tests &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; I write code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the tests, I am using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jestjs.io&quot;&gt;Jest&lt;/a&gt;. Namely because Jest is easy to setup and get going and I have familiarity with Jest from using it with Node.js and Nest.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First Problem.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only in the past few years of my career that I have started to break out of the negative thought pattern that I wasn&apos;t a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; developer. Part of that pattern remains and is somewhat rooted in the fact that while I write code that &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. I am never quite sure if the code I write is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Good is subjective in a sense, but from my perspective I mean good in the sense that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code is not terrible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code follows good practice and is up to date with modern methods. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code is sensible and readable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, doing this first problem some thoughts that go through my head are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know using for loops is not trendy and does not follow functional programming. As such, I started out using .map(). This then revealed a flaw in my thinking because I did not want to return a new array, I &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; wanted to iterate over the numbers and add them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From that thinking, .map was not suitable because it returns a new array and I did not want a new array. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, .filter and .reduce were not suitable either. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I considered forEach, however, I remembered reading somewhere that ultimately, for loops were still more performant than forEach. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had the emails suggested 60 minute timeline in mind, as such, decided to &lt;em&gt;solve&lt;/em&gt; on the spot so I went for the trusty old for loop! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, much of what I have written above might be wrong and as a result, I have some homework to do! Namely to find out: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt;  Is a for loop more performant than forEach? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt;  Is there a more modern ES6 construct that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; iterates without return a new collection? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt;  I want to write a solution using modern ES6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app projectName&lt;/code&gt; instead of the traditional &lt;code&gt;npm install create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; -&gt; &lt;code&gt;create-react-app projectName&lt;/code&gt; route. It&apos;s quicker, easier and gets away from the challenge of managing global versions of npm packages. Read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b&quot;&gt;npx here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3C;React.Fragment&gt;&lt;/code&gt; lets you contain a component without an extra surrounding div. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In React, you pass arrow functions for event handling when you want to pass parameters. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3C;a className=&quot;page-link&quot; onClick={() =&gt; props.onPaginate(page)}&gt;
    {page}
&amp;#x3C;/a&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pass child HTML elements of a component to the component via this.props.children. Children is an array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When managing events, essentially, you want to bubble the event up to the controlling parent. It&apos;s bubbles all the way up...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en&quot;&gt;React Dev Tools&lt;/a&gt; (which you really should install - its great!), you can get a handle on a selected element to evaluate it on the Dev Tools console via $r. You can then apply functions to this such as $r.click(); This is similar to, in the &apos;Elements&apos; tab in Dev Tools where you can access and element via $0. Sidenote: I use the &apos;Darcula&apos; theme!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Props are what you &lt;em&gt;pass&lt;/em&gt; to a component. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State is private or local to a component and is not shared with other components. Should you want to share state, you need to &lt;em&gt;lift the state up&lt;/em&gt; to a parent component so you can share it. One-way data flow! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components that do not have their own state are known as &lt;em&gt;Controlled Components&lt;/em&gt;. Often times, if there is no state and if there are no extra functions within the component, you can use a &lt;em&gt;Stateless Function Component&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stateless function components can be easily setup via VS Code Simple React Snippets via: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;imr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can then create your stateless function component via: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sfc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There seems to be a fair amount of &lt;em&gt;lifting&lt;/em&gt; in React ...and I don&apos;t mean weights :). As you grow your component base, you often find yourself &lt;em&gt;lifting state up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lifecycle Hooks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount -&gt; constructor, render, componentDidMount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update -&gt; render, componentDidUpdate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unmount -&gt; componentWillUnmount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// note that render will recursively render all child components.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I spend more time using React, it strikes me as being a lot simpler in constrast to Angular. While my React experience is limited at this stage, it seems that React is quite &lt;em&gt;rigid&lt;/em&gt; in the approach you need to take with it. By comparing the React Tutorial with the Angular Tour of Heroes Tutorial, React seems to do a lot less. No routing, no http. It is just a view and, it seems, is primarily concerned with passing props down and bubbling events up. But despite being less, it seems to me to make the app a lot easier to reason about. That being said, I feel that learning React is going to improve the clarity of my thinking when it comes to using Angular and applying these same approach there. Angular, despite being &lt;em&gt;heavier&lt;/em&gt; than React, also advocates for one-way data flow and a functional, component based approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was a lack of AngularJs experience and not fully understanding the AngularJs ecosystem when I first started learning AngularJs all those years ago. Or maybe, to some extent, it is that Angular is more &lt;em&gt;magical&lt;/em&gt;, but it seems to me that while React is a little strange to get going with at first, and seems a lot stricter in the way it expects you to code. I find that this is liberating and exciting in that you need to stick to some fundamental rules and patterns which simplifies and clarifies your thinking and reasoning about your code.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mastering React.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have started a new online course called  Mastering React  by Mosh Hamedani.

&lt;p&gt;The Node.js course takes one through the development of an example app called Vidly, but in the course of developing it, Mosh takes you through modern ES6 syntax, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Helmet, Winston, TDD-testing with Jest, authentication with JWT and a host of other topics. The content and the delivery of the course are excellent. I found that Mosh has a way of explaining things that really resonates with me and it felt like many topics really clicked for me throughout the course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, when I saw he had self-published* a course on React I was immediately interested. Especially because the React course builds a front-end for the Vidly app created in the Node.js course. I felt it would be a great follow-on to that course. Now that I have been dipping my toe into the React world it is the prefect time to start the course so that I fill out my React knowledge and understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html&quot;&gt;React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial&lt;/a&gt; (I believe it was written by Dan Abramov since the CodePens are under his GitHub name) really whetted my appetite and even though I am only about 20% through the Mastering React course, I already feel like some of the React concepts I started picking up on last week are starting to click in a more meaningful way! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The Complete Node.js Course by Mosh Hamedani is published on Udemy along with many of his other courses. He has since started self-publishig courses on his own platform at &lt;a href=&quot;https://programmingwithmosh.com/courses/&quot;&gt;Programming With Mosh&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Simple React Snippets.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Simple React Snippets  is a VS Code Extensions by Burke Holland which, in a manner similar to Emmet enables you to tab out shortcode into…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0064/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0064/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=burkeholland.simple-react-snippets&quot;&gt;Simple React Snippets&lt;/a&gt; is a VS Code Extensions by Burke Holland which, in a manner similar to Emmet enables you to tab out shortcode into code snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, pressing tab after typing out the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;imrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will give you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React, { Component } from &apos;react&apos;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, typing &lt;code&gt;cc&lt;/code&gt;, then hitting tab will give you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class extends Component {
    state = {  }
    render() {
        return (  );
    }
}

export default ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s great about this, is that the snippet will expand with double-cursors active in the place where you enter the className which makes it super simple to create your boilerplate. Once the className is typed you press the &apos;esc&apos; key and cursor will go back to single cursor mode. Very cool!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ionic and Vue Tutorial Notes.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the past few days I have been going through several 'official' introductory tutorials.

&lt;h4&gt;Ionic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I spent some time doing a basic Ionic app based on what I did for an Angular todo app. Having some familiarity with Ionic, I went through the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/tutorial/&quot;&gt;Ionic tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. Of the tutorials I have gone through recently, this was the most disappointing since it was not so much a tutorial as it was a walk-through of the code generated by the Ionic CLI. It was interesting to me to see how heavily Ionic uses Angular, and the example app provided is useful and relevant. The rub is that it was not a &quot;tutorial&quot; as such. You do not write any code, nor build anything on top of the provided starter theme. My feeling is that there could be a lot more value learning and development-wise in having an actual tutorial where you build an example, rudimentary application on top of the starter app. So far, both Angular and React tutorials are better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did stand out in terms of Ionic was their excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#overview&quot;&gt;component library guide&lt;/a&gt;. The Components are cleanly presented with a mobile view on the right which lets you toggle between iOS, Android and Windows Phone views of the Ionic components demonstrating how each component looks and operates in the different environment alongside the code usage on the left. While the information and presentation was great, what I really &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; where the examples! All the examples were heavily pop-culture-inspired with reference to Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and many more which made going through the examples a lot more fun than they might have been otherwise! I really enjoyed going through component guide and it made me excited to spend more time working with Ionic. Especially since I can leverage and expand on my existing Angular knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started going through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Getting-Started&quot;&gt;Vue docs&lt;/a&gt;, however, as far as I can see, there is no official tutorial as such. There is a link to a free Vue course on a site called Vue Mastery where it looks as though they take you through building a page on an example e-commerce site. However, the docs themselves take the approach of various separate, standalone code examples rather than going through a step-by-step build of an example application. Personally, I prefer a text based, step-by-step tutorial where you can build &apos;something&apos; in an hour or two as opposed to disparate examples or a video course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t get me wrong, I am a big believer in online courses, and I have found immense value in doing several online courses. However, context is important and onlie video courses are very time intensive, and, what I am currently looking to do is complete a tutorial that within a few hours will take me through building an example app which will demonstrate the various building blocks of the framework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will need to stick with the Vue docs for a while to see if a more cohesive example or tutorial is presented. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Redis Notes.]]></title><description><![CDATA[These are some Redis cheat sheet notes: Installation wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-5.0.3.tar.gz tar xzf redis-5.0.3.tar.gz cd…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0062/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0062/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;These are some Redis cheat sheet notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-5.0.3.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tar xzf redis-5.0.3.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd redis-5.0.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will then need to run &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, however, in order to do this, you first need to have the X Code Command Line Tools installed on your Mac. You can install these by (Note: &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the XCode Command Line Tools will be installed, not all of XCode): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;xcode-select --install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agree to the T&amp;#x26;Cs and follows the prompts. Once installed, in your redis folder run: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thereafter, run &lt;code&gt;make test&lt;/code&gt; to ensure all is well! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Redis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once setup, &lt;code&gt;cd src&lt;/code&gt;, in src, run &lt;code&gt;redis-server&lt;/code&gt;. This will get your Redis server running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new Terminal (Ctrl + T), cd into your redis/src folder again and run: &lt;code&gt;redis-cli&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in the CLI, you can run your Redis commands: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Redis Commands&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INFO // give you your Redis server info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CONFIG GET * // returns all Redis keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CONFIG GET databases // returns all dbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SELECT 0 // will select the first db&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEYS * // will return all keys in a db&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React components (except for function components) define super(props) in the constructor (when used)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Components (except for function components) extend React.Component and have a render function which returns the component. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class components display information via this.props. Function components do not make use of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; a view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you call setState in a component, React automatically updates the child components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lifting State&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;...the best approach is to store the game&apos;s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square. The Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop...&quot; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#lifting-state-up&quot;&gt;Lifing state&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declare the shared state in the parent component. Parent component can pass the state back down to the children by using props. This keeps the children in sync with each other and with the parent component. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifting state into a parent component is common in React when refactoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In React, however, it is a convention to use on [Event] names for props which represent events and handle [Event] for the methods which handle the events.&quot; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#lifting-state-up&quot;&gt;Lifting state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child components should not store state and the inform parents of events which are bubbled up. These are ‘dumb’ or rather ‘controlled components’. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits of immutability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex features become simple - for example, time-travel. Avoiding direct data mutation lets us keep previous versions of history intact and can be re-used later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detecting changes - detecting change in mutable object is difficult as they are modified directly. This detection requires mutable object to be compared to previous copies of itself and the entire object tree to be traversed. Detecting changes in immutable object is easier since if the object being reference is different than the previous one, the object has changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-rendering - the primary benefit is that you can build pure components. Easily determine change and then determine if re-render is required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Function components only contain one render function - as such, can re-write it to only be a function that takes props as an argument and is not a class. In a class, you need a proper arrow function to access this. In function component, you do not need to access this, so you do not need the arrow function to access the props. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Key&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strongly recommended to assign proper keys when building dynamic lists! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;key is a special and reserved property in React (along with ref, a more advanced feature). When an element is created, React extracts the key property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though key may look like it belongs in props, key cannot be referenced using this.props.key. React automatically uses key to decide which components to update. A component cannot inquire about its key.&quot; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#picking-a-key&quot;&gt;Picking a key&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the root of your project, create a nodemon-debug.json file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-{&quot;&gt;    &quot;watch&quot;: [&quot;src&quot;],
    &quot;ext&quot;: &quot;ts&quot;,
    &quot;ignore&quot;: [&quot;src/**/*.spec.ts&quot;],
    &quot;exec&quot;: &quot;node --inspect-brk -r tsconfig-paths/register -r ts-node/register src/main.ts&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your package.json file, create a task as follows
&lt;code&gt;&quot;start:debug&quot;: &quot;nodemon --config nodemon-debug.json&quot;,&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your VS Code Preferences: Code -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Search for Auto Attach and enable this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, from terminal run: &lt;code&gt;npm run start:debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VS Code will then auto-attach the debugger and you can develop as usual, with the benefit of running your breakpoints directly from VS Code while still testing and using your app usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to keep pressing the &quot;Continue&quot; button in the debugging menu, and the server is slower in operation, but, the benefit of being able to debug right in VS Code is massive! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bonus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running an Angular app, make sure you create an npm start task that runs the --open flag. This will run your Angular app as well as open it in your default browser! Nice and handy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;start&quot;: &quot;ng serve --open&quot;,&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Official Docs.]]></title><description><![CDATA[In recent time, I have found it immensely valuable to, in detail, go through the official "Getting Started" guides/tutorials and…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0059/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0059/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent time, I have found it immensely valuable to, in detail, go through the official &quot;Getting Started&quot; guides/tutorials and documentation for frameworks. Namely because this is, in many ways, the source of truth. The creators and developers of the frameworks themselves have put together these guides, as such, the knowledge and information is &lt;em&gt;straight-from-the-horses&apos;-mouth&lt;/em&gt; if you will. As such, it is understood that the manner of doing things demonstrated can be considered best practice. This is in contrast to what you may learn from a tutorial or blog online which may or may not be according to best practice and may or may not reflect the most up to date expression and thinking on the topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week I have gone (or revisited) the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular.io/tutorial&quot;&gt;Angular Tour of Heroes Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps&quot;&gt;Nest.js Docs&lt;/a&gt;. Sections completed so far: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview (all topics excluding Interceptors and Exception filters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Techniques (Authentication, Database [Postgres, MySQL, Mongo], Validation, Logger)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/&quot;&gt;Gatsby.js Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still need to revisit some of these, but it is really impressive how much one learns from these resources. Additionally, I feel that while the examples, and applications might be somewhat trivial, they set a solid base - especially in terms of properly organising and structuring your code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you go through Tour of Heroes, they cover a range of topics that cover: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event, input and property bindings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Http&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observables is an interesting one, take for instance the following information: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the switchMap operator, every qualifying key event can trigger an HttpClient.get() method call. Even with a 300ms pause between requests, you could have multiple HTTP requests in flight and they may not return in the order sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;switchMap() preserves the original request order while returning only the observable from the most recent HTTP method call. Results from prior calls are canceled and discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that canceling a previous searchHeroes() Observable doesn&apos;t actually abort a pending HTTP request. Unwanted results are simply discarded before they reach your application code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;blows my mind&lt;/em&gt;! The functionality and benefit provided out the box by switchMap alone is impressive! Now, I know &apos;rxjs&apos; is a separate library and not Angular specific, but, if you were to continue coding things the way you have always coded them before, you would miss out on the phenomenal functionality and capability operators like this give you straight away! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another exampe is the extensive use of Decorators in both Angular and Nest.js (which is heavily inspired and follos many of the Angular conventions). Decorators make the code so much easier to read while masking a lot of functionality behind the scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are cosidering dipping your toe into any coding topic, I would suggest and strongly advocate to set aside several hours to go through the official &apos;Getting started&apos; guides, tutorials and documentation. Even though developers trditionally &lt;em&gt;dislike&lt;/em&gt; documentation, it feels to me that documentation is getting far better and more thoughtful than it was in past days! That, or maybe I just did not read it properly! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Gatsby.js, while Gatsby does the heavy-lifting for you, it is a really nice and easy way into more advanced topics such as GraphQL, which clearly, is an important topic in development for the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Miscellaneous Thoughts on JWT and Nest.js.]]></title><description><![CDATA[When pasting your JWT token  here .

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pasting your JWT token &lt;a href=&quot;https://jwt.io/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Remember to enter your &apos;secretKey&apos; in the provided blue input in the &quot;Verify Signature&quot; block (bottom right). If you don&apos;t do this, you will get an &quot;Invalid Signature&quot; validation error which may lead you down a rabbit hole, only to find, there was nothing wrong with your token, you just did not see the input field! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the documentation and provided examples covering &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.nestjs.com/guards&quot;&gt;Guards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/authentication&quot;&gt;Authentication&lt;/a&gt; very carefully. There are several details that are easy to miss if you are not paying attention! For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using @UseGuards decorator, you can comma-separate several guards within one decorator. Doing this, gives your guards somewhat &lt;em&gt;magical&lt;/em&gt; access to the user object. My mistake, but I listed my guards within separate decorators which lead me on a roundabout that took a while to get back from. I say &lt;em&gt;magical&lt;/em&gt; because, the example uses request.user to access roles, but this element is not defined. However, within one decorator, it just works... which is weird, and I am not sure I understand why...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the documentation assumes or shortcuts implementations for the sake of brevity, but at the loss of clarity - this can sometimes lead one to thinking that a complete example is incomplete, or that an incomplete example is complete - leading to confusion and more roundabouts when doing your own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the explanations and examples very carefully and work them through step-by-step, Nest.js, like Angular, does a lot for you behind the scenes, so sometimes, it can be quite confusing when things do not (or do) work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I really like Nest.js! It makes a lot of sense to me and I like that it handles so many common use-cases in Node.js development. Writing Nest.js is succinct onces you understand the conventions and patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, at times, if you are not quite up-to-speed with Nest.js, it can get a little confusing when you run into areas you don&apos;t quite understand. To some extent, I feel that while writing plain-old-Node.js might be more verbose and take longer up front, the fact that it is more &apos;DIY&apos; makes it easier to read and reason about when you come back to it later.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bcrypt.]]></title><description><![CDATA[As far as I can remember, each time I have used the npm module  bcrypt  I have run into installation/running errors.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/issues/678&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accepted &apos;solution&apos; seems to be that, should you run into these issues, you need to use up/downgraded versions of Node.js and/or of bcrypt or some combination of both. In the past, I have resolved this by downgrading bcrypt to v1.0.3, however, considering the version is now up to 3.0.3, I don&apos;t feel this is a &apos;solution&apos; since it requires running older version of Node.js. If that does not solve the problem, one may need to rebuild bcrypt accordingly, by running: &lt;code&gt;npm rebuild bcrypt --build-from-source&lt;/code&gt;. This however, in my case, also leads to further errors with the node-pre-gyp, which, when you go down the rabbit hole, eventually leads you to having to install all kinds of other dependencies including X Code Command Line Tools!?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, this is all a bit much for me. The dependency chain is too deep and fickle/fragile in my experience. As a result, I looked around and found that there is a Javascript-based version of bcrypt called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs&quot;&gt;bcryptjs&lt;/a&gt;. It mimics the API of bcrypt, as such, you can keep your bcrypt code the same if you import the module as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import * as bcrypt from &apos;bcryptjs&apos;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, it should be noted that bcryptjs is 30% slower than bcrypt. 30% sounds like a lot, but I did not notice any meaningful slowness, if anything, it was faster because bcryptjs actually worked! That being considered, I would rather have a smoother development experience with &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; slower processing, than a completely confusing and befuddling developer experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this process, I have also come to realise that Node.js has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html&quot;&gt;crypto&lt;/a&gt; module which I will need to explore in future. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Postgres Cheat Sheet.]]></title><description><![CDATA[My Postgres cheat sheet: Add this to your .bash_profile to ensure  psql  in on your path (Mac):

It sits on top of Cordova. Up until version 3, Ionic served Angular exclusively. The upcoming version 4 will however introduce WebComponents into the mix as well as the possibility to support React and Vue alongside Angular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having never done mobile development and in the process of working on Angular, I thought it would be a good time to give Ionic a try. Here are some initial thoughts after starting to work with it today: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ionic CLI is built on top of the Angular CLI, but it is &lt;em&gt;noticeably&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;considerably&lt;/em&gt; slower in my experience (MacBook Pro, High Sierra, circa 2012).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While my application is rudimentary, building the app is essentially identical to building one with Angular, except that you can make use of Ionic&apos;s premade components which provide default styling and functionality (similar to Bootstrap).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From what I have seen, Ionic 4 is different to Ionic 4 in enough ways to mean you should be looking for v4 specific examples. (Note: Ionic 4 is far more &lt;em&gt;Angular-y&lt;/em&gt; by the looks of it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I have only experimented with the &quot;web&quot; part of it, I am curious to see how these Ionic components translate into &quot;native&quot; components in terms of look and feel. I imagine they must change quite drastically in appearance because, as it stands, the app I am building with default Ionic styling, looks nothing like stock-standard iOS or Android controls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have barely even come close to scratching the surface of this, I am excited to be learning something new that can take advantage of my existing skills. I also feel, that in some ways, Ionic or ReactNative will provide an interesting bridge to actual native mobile development one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;MySQL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default location for MySQL installation (on Mac) is: /usr/local/mysql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you get an error when running: &lt;code&gt;mysql --version&lt;/code&gt; it likely means you do not have mysql added to your $PATH. Check this by: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is not there, you will need either add it to your session via: &lt;code&gt;export path=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or you can add it to your .bash_profile file, this is typically located at: /usr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to start your MySQL session, in terminal, run: &lt;code&gt;mysql -h hostNameGoesHere -u usernameGoesHere -p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can start or stop your MySQL server from System Preferences. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To access a specific database, you can run: &lt;code&gt;mysql -h hostNameGoesHere -u usernameGoesHere -p databaseNameGoesHere&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In MySQL terms, Schemas and Databases are synonyms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can install MySQL Workbench separately as a GUI for interfacing with MySQL. (I tried using DBeaver, but I had some issues with the MySQL Driver, so have not got it working yet.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TypeORM&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into the following error when trying to connect to MySQL from TypeORM: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Error: ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this happens is explained in detail &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/issues/1959&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but in short, MySQL 8.0.4 introduced a new default authentication mechanism &apos;caching&lt;em&gt;sha2&lt;/em&gt;pasword&apos;. This is more secure than the previous method used by MySQL, which is &apos;mysql&lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt;password&apos;. Now, TypeORM, under the hood, uses mysqljs (I think). Work is being done in order to support this new authentication, however, as of writing, it has not been merged into master. As such, in order to get around this, on MySQL, you need to do the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ALTER USER &apos;userName&apos;@&apos;hostName&apos; IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY &apos;passwordHere&apos;;
SELECT plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE User = &apos;root&apos;; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereafter, you need to run (from the MySQL terminal): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FLUSH PRIVILEGES;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;quit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop MySQL server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start MySQL server. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not be able to run TypeORM again and hopefully it will connect. If not, you may find some guidance by reviewing the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2093&quot;&gt;TypeORM issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/issues/1507&quot;&gt;mysqljs issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TypeORM and Nest.js&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I dug into all of the above in order to add a MySQL database to my Itemly API.

My initial thoughts are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vue.js&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue.js seems to sit somewhere between AngularJs and React in that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vue uses custom attributes such as v-model and v-for which are akin to Angular ng-model or ng-repeat (ngFor). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vue seems to use props and data, which on the surface seems React-like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s interesting that Vue uses .vue files which separate out/contain template, script and style in sections in one file. This looks like it would be useful in small applications, but I am not sure how well it will work once apps get larger? (Maybe if components are kept small and data-flow is well managed it won&apos;t be an issue.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vue seems to &apos;just work&apos; in a way that reminds me of the original AngularJs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;React&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React.js looks to be quite different to Angular in several ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webpack/Babel was a bit tricky to setup (I did not use create-react-app). *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very component based.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems to be &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a view layer (whereas AngularJs bundles most of what you need together into one opinionated framework).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redux is interesting... &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is far too early for me to have much of an opinion either way, but it is interesting to be trying something different for a change! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding Webpack/Babel - The part I struggled with in setting up Webpack/Babel was that &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; would not be recognised. I tried updating to @babel without any luck. Then attempted using plugin-dynamic-import and node-plugin-dynamic import without success. Finally, I updated to Webpack 4 and removed the plugins and it just seemed to work! :)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal GitHub account/GitHub pages do not have access to a gh-pages branch nor a /docs folder in master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;gh-pages and /docs.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User accounts &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; have access to a master branch, meaning index.html will be served from there. This puts the brakes on my plans to incorporate a Circle CI build into this workflow for the moment and leaves with a rather messy private repo which is not in sync with my true repo. I will need to look into how to resolve this since at present, my &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; master branch contains the Gatsby source files along with the markdown files that are the source of these blog posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the GitHub repo is now actually the /public folder, which is not really what I want to keep in source control since it muddies up the repo. Use of a /docs folder would have resolved this for me, but alas, my account does not allow for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a very brief look at the options when adding a new repo, as well as for signing up a &apos;Project&apos; on GitHub, but I am not quite sure how or where this is defined. It seems to me that I will need to look into alternatives for hosting my development blog since GitHub Pages does not quite suit my needs when it comes to managing and serving the code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Folder Structure.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another topic I took a look into was moving all my .md files into their own folder within my &apos;src&apos; folder. This only half-worked, since it seems to mess up the routing of my links as well as the build at times. I will need to look into this further because it bugs me that I have .js files mixed in amongst a whole lot of .md files. Anyway, its a nice-to-have so I will get to it at some point. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gatsby and Circle CI (Part 2).]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since my site runs on Gatsby, and the setup of my source branch in respect to my GitHub page was not ideal, I set about to update this setup…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0051/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0051/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since my site runs on Gatsby, and the setup of my source branch in respect to my GitHub page was not ideal, I set about to update this setup. The steps I planned to take were two-fold: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update Gatsby and all the plugin dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort out my repo structure so that I can keep both my source and serving folders in one repo. (Thus enabling a Circle CI build)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating Gatsby was simple enough, after a few false starts, I took the following approach: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleted my node_modules folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleted all my dependencies and devDependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-installed all the necessary dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made a few code updates in order to enable the migration. (These steps are highlighted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that was sorted out, I set about updating my repo structure. A few points on this topic: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User repositories that use GitHub pages with same username can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; serve their GitHub pages from &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; branch. (Only project accounts have the option to serve from either a &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;gh-pages&lt;/em&gt; branch.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within master, you can serve your site from a /docs folder. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The challenge here is that Gatsby only builds into a /public folder. Changing the name of the output folder is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/1878#issuecomment-419614298&quot;&gt;not supported&lt;/a&gt; by Gatsby. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A workaround here is to create a new script in your package.json to rename the public folder to dist once the build task has completed. Something like: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...
&quot;rename&quot;: &quot;mv public docs&quot;,
&quot;rebuild&quot;: &quot;gatsby build &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; npm run rename&quot;,
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once running the task, the site will be built as per usual and the folder renamed. This folder then needs to be added to the repo (since public is excluded via .gitignore): git add docs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then push to master. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, my GitHub page is now serving me README.md file at the homepage. However, I am hoping that, it is just taking some time for GitHub to realise that my index.html file has moved to my /docs folder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence me writing this post in order to kickstart another deployment. Fingers crossed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: I was misguided in my attempts above. As it turns out, personal user accounts &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; have the ability/option to serve their front-end from a gh-pages branch, nor do they have the option to serve the files from a /docs folder. These are only available to &apos;Project&apos; repos. As a result, while I learned a lot through this exercise, I have ultimately had to revert to my old deployment process for now. I will need to look into hosting my front-end elsewhere so that I can incorporate a pipeline and clean up my repos a little. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gatsby and Circle CI (Part 1).]]></title><description><![CDATA[My GitHub page runs on Gatsby, currently, I use a deploy task to push my published HTML pages to GitHub, this however, has lead to my repo…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0050/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0050/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My GitHub page runs on Gatsby, currently, I use a deploy task to push my published HTML pages to GitHub, this however, has lead to my repo being somewhat confused since the repo on GitHub is actually the published files, not the source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to resolve this, I have started experimenting with Circle CI as a build tool. Circle CI promises &quot;power, flexibility and control&quot; and the ability to automate from commit to deploy. Circle CI offers a generous unlimited amount of repos and users, with up to 1000 build minutes on 1 container and 1 concurrent job. Sounds great! That is more than enough for my use case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to Azure Pipelines, Circle CI uses .yml files to setup the necessary instructions for your pipeline. I worked from the default Node.js Circle CI configuration. &lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-javascript/&quot;&gt;More here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On first pass, when importing my source into GitHub, I was greeted with numerous GitHub security warnings, many of them &apos;High&apos;, which was a little concerning! In order to resolve these, I updated Gatsby to the latest version. While this resolved the security warnings, it broke my Gatsby local Gatsby develop task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some digging around, I found that some of the older Gatsby versions were incompatible with the latest versions. Since I want to keep publishing posts on my blog, I did not want to sit with a broken blog while I migrate the site to a completely revamped Gatsby site. As a result, I downgraded Gatsby to the latest suggested version according to the installed dependencies. After some tweaking and upgrading some individual dependencies, I was able to get my local gatsby develop and build tasks working again! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was back to Circle CI to build... which failed again! This time complaining about unresolved dependencies. Namely Gatsby CLI was looking for resolve-cwd (by the prolific Sindre Sorhus). I then added Gatsby CLI to my dev dependencies and tried again. To my delight, this resolved the issue and Circle CI was able to successfully install and build my Gatsby site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, sorting out the deployment! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sourcerer.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sourcerer  is a'visual profile for software engineers'.

Effectively, it is a service and command-line app that scans your Git repos and builds a visual representation of the technology you work with in your projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You link the service up with your GitHub (or GitLab or BitBucket) account and then the service will scan your public (not private) repos and build a Sourcerer profile page representing your code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my mind, this page serves as a far more interesting talking point than a resume or CV. The problem with CVs is that, while someone &apos;says&apos; that they can code this and have that experience - how do you really know? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it mean that they code a little bit of JavaScript or a lot? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they list PHP on their resume, does that actually mean they edited a WordPress template that one time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they say they know Angular, did they just do a Hello World and call it a day? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, once can provide provide links to work, but unless it is a personal portfolio or project, it is not a very good gauge on an individual&apos;s contributions. Often times, people work in teams on larger projects, with multiple contributors and different stages of the project. Viewing any particular site shows what the team has done over a period of time, not necessarily the individual in the team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub profiles are also very useful, since you can see what someone has actually done. But GitHub comes with the downside that, if you work for a company that keeps its repos private, then chances are that, unless you contribute to open source prolifically, your GitHub repos are probably more a collection of oddities than a true representation of ability. That is unless you have a convincing side project on there, publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sourcerer fills the gap between resume and public GitHub profile very well! In addition to their online service, Sourcerer provide a command-line app that lets you scan your local repos and send the various stats and facts to your Sourcerer profile. This way, you can provide real stats on your day-to-day work if your GitHub profile is not that significant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the command-line app &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sourcerer-io/sourcerer-app&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You install it from the command-line by: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -s https://sourcerer.io/app/install | bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, you run: &lt;code&gt;sourcerer&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app will prompt you to provide the file path and Sourcerer will scan the repo. One thing to note here is that you need to provide the email address linked to your Git commits for that repo in order for them to appear on your profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Your personal email will not appear on your profile anywhere, nor is your code sent to any servers or made public. Sourcerer just scans the repos for the data such as: number of commits, technology/frameworks used, lines of code, dates/times etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Profile&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Sourcere profile page itself, as an example, you can see mine &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcerer.io/nicholaspretorius&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up top if shows the number of commits, repos and lines of code. Below that is a colourful timeline/graph that highlights the different technologies you work with. Beneath that, it shows a breakdown of the broader technology categories you work with and then below that goes into more details in terms of the libraries and frameworks. Finally, it wraps up with some &quot;Fun facts&quot; with graphs showing your most active times, days on which you commit most and then some stats indicating some demographics in terms of how much you use certain tech in contract with generalised stats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cool as all of this is, it should be taken with a pinch of salt in that, these stats look at numbers... they do not look at code quality. So one still needs to take the time to dig deeper. However, a service like, at a glance, provides a great, high-level overview of the work a developer does! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Azure DevOps.]]></title><description><![CDATA[We host one of our applications on an Azure App Service.

The project is deployed manually (not ideal). As a result, I have been looking into options for running builds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping in mind we are a corporate company, with some restrictions around &apos;blueprint&apos;. Typically, we use Jenkins as a CI solution, however, this is typically hosted within our network. Additionally, CIaaS (CI as a Service) that is offered internally, is limited in scope to our Java or C# projects. As a result, our solution is not quite suited to purpose since we need to deploy outside the network and likely need to manage our own dependencies outside the corporate Nexus repo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we already host on Azure, and use VS Code, I was curious to see what the recently re-branded Azure DevOps (&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/&quot;&gt;formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services&lt;/a&gt;), would have in store. What I found was interesting and compelling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free up to 5 users with 1800 build minutes per month. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlimited repos (private or public)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the name, Azure DevOps is not limited to Azure but can deploy to AWS or GCP as well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we already have an existing Azure account, I signed up, what I found was surprising. But, first, some background: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two years ago, our company started making use of the Atlassian suit of products, namely: Jira, Confluence and most importantly BitBucket. As such, we moved away from our very old and ungainly ticketing system as well as migrated from Subversion (Tortoise SVN) towards Git. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we did not take up Bamboo, Atlassian&apos;s CI product. Additionally, we stuck to using HP ALM for testing and defect management along with Nexus for dependency management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging into Azure DevOps, I was greeted with a pleasantly laid out hub design, presenting an ever-present side-menu containing the following items (which equate to more or less comparitive competitor products): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wiki (+- Confluence)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repos (+- BitBucket)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boards (+- Jira)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pipelines (+- Bamboo/Jenkins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Plan (+- XRay)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artefacts (+- Nexus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketplace (for integrations into other things)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my eyes, this is a pretty compelling product and competes directly with Atlassian&apos;s toolkit. Considering the easy integration options into Azure, I was convinced to give it a shot. As a result, I decided to forge ahead and migrated our master branch into Azure Repos and set about building up the pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to follow in a future post...&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thoughts on API Specifications and Swagger.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Having spent the better part of the last year working on one project that is completely reliant on a third-party API. As well as another…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0047/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0047/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Having spent the better part of the last year working on one project that is completely reliant on a third-party API. As well as another project, that is heavily reliant on several third-party APIs, I have developed some opinions on the matter that, in my own journey to improve as a developer has inspired some of my own behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, one of the mentioned third-party APIs has been somewhat difficult to work with due to the fact that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no Swagger UI (or equivalent) to interact with. As such, I needed to construct my own PostMan collection to make testing/exploration easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The documentation, while decent, is separate from the tool I use to test, as such, I need to continually switch between a developer portal and PostMan. (If you account for the 15 minute time out on the developer portal, it can get painful having to switch and login continually)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the above, after some searching, I came across Swagger and the concept of API-First design and development. As I see them, the benefits of designing (and sharing) the Swagger document up front are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API&apos;s can be designed and distributed (thus starting the feedback loop earlier) before any code is written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests can start to be written sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mocks can be setup sooner, which enables the front-end team to work without having to wait on the back-end team. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliverables can then be validated against the specification to make sure all is as it should be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these in mind, and with the goal of improving my own development skills and habits, I set about with the following goals when starting to build my example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nicholaspretorius/itemly&quot;&gt;Itemly&lt;/a&gt; todo API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Goals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I first wrote, and included a swagger.yml API specification document in the repo. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have included Swagger UI from the beginning (using @nestjs/swagger). Despite the app being rudimentary, it is important to enable a mechanism whereby anyone can start to interact with, and manually test the APIs while in development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have included Typedoc early on for code documentation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In future, I will add an API collection document (i.e. PostMan or Insomnia) to the repo so that, if needed, these collections can be shared or used in API testing should someone not have access to Swagger UI for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write my .yml in VS code (in order to better learn the structure)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing, I run the file through the swagger-cli in order to validate as I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i -g swagger-cli
swagger-cli validate swagger.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once ready, or when completing endpoints, I will paste the spec into the online Swagger Editor for validation (the validation and error messages are pretty good here)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the API writing process above, admittedly, it is not particularly efficient. Some areas for improvement are:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could include swagger-cli into an npm task - &lt;code&gt;swagger-cli validate&lt;/code&gt; error messages, while useful, do not include line numbers - hence the pasting into the Swagger Editor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On that note, the Swagger Editor has the great benefit of being able to instantly generate the Swagger UI on the fly, which really helps one &quot;see&quot; the API a lot better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will look for a VS Code extension which can validate the Swagger document within VS Code itself.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area I am currently looking into is how to effectively mock the API - either by using a tool such as WireMock or Mock Server, or by finding a tool to which I can pass the Swagger document and it will generate the mocks for me - something like Swagger Hub, PostMan or Stoplight might be candidates in this area. However, I will share more on this in a future post! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reset.]]></title><description><![CDATA[As we reach the end of the year, and work slows down that little bit, we have a brief moment to reflect, reset and refocus.

For me, that starts with starting to pick up on some of where I left off. Writing, both words and code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, I am working on a rudimentary Todo API using Nest.js. You can find it here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nicholaspretorius/itemly&quot;&gt;Itemly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea here is try and build an improved habit for writing cleaner, more modular code, better tests and documenting in Swagger and Typedoc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I have written so far has been from following the examples in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.nestjs.com/&quot;&gt;Nest.js documentation&lt;/a&gt; as well as taking some cues from other repos. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thoughts on Agile and Lean.]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Lean Startup by Eric Ries should be required reading for any person contributing to the creation of software (or other) products.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lean Startup by Eric Ries should be required reading for any person contributing to the creation of software (or other) products. While the focus of the book is entrepreneurs and startups, Ries rightly points out that even if you work within a company, you can adopt an entrepreneurial mindset and the lean startup process. An intrapreneur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular I have been incredibly interested in the &quot;Build Measure Learn&quot; (BML) loop. Having adopted Agile where I work, coming from a traditional waterfall background, I feel as though our particular flavour of Agile sits primarily in the &quot;Build&quot; phase. While Agile has holds the Retrospective as an opportunity to learn, and has the Burndown as a means to measure velocity, it feels much to me like that learning is limited to development and the rituals that lead to development work being allocated. The application of measuring and learning about the product, market, customer and how that fuels development is largely ignored. The Lean mindset applies the build/measure/learn method to the entire cycle. This, while obvious when you read it, feels very much to be missing from our own development cycles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in &quot;IT&quot; at a fairly &lt;em&gt;traditional&lt;/em&gt; company. In the company structure, there is a divide between &quot;business&quot; and &quot;IT&quot;. &quot;Business&quot; makes the money (the product is not software) and IT is there generally to support or enable the business. Agile advocates to bring the two groups closer so that the business can be directly involved via the product owner, write stories, prioritize the backlog and be more engaged in product creation. However, while this relationship begins to traverse the &lt;em&gt;divide&lt;/em&gt;, I feel this structure disincentivizes IT from adopting and advocating for the tighter, more nuanced improvements products and customers demand. You get what you tolerate and my feeling is that unless IT in so-called traditional companies step up to actively feed and contribute to the BML cycle, the products and means by which they are delivered will always be lacking in some aspect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile focuses on delivery - delivery of working software specifically. But what good is delivery of a functional product that does not deliver true customer value?
Successful products require alignment of business model, incentives, product-market fit all wrapped up in effective software delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether there is an IT and business, or both or neither, it does not matter. If you are building software products that are not paid for by the consumer or are only used internally, all the more reason to focus on the BML cycle in order to understand the true value you should deliver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you do not buy the above arguments, I think it would be wise to accept that you need build measurements, metrics and validated learnings directly into your product process. If you are not able to answer the questions required for business to answer value questions, how, as a professional in the workforce can you effectively evaluate your effectiveness or the value you generate? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The further I progress in my career, the more I realise you need to OWN your work like never before. Even if you are not a founder, a CEO, a manager or project lead, you would do well to consider yourself the CEO of your own value generation. If not, how can you value or shape your own progress? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some extent, reading The Lean Startup has been as revelatory to me as when I was first introduced to the nature of functional and dvisional organisations. Working in a functional organisation serving a divisional one, it became clear that many of the frustrations and challenges we faced were not unique, that is to say, caused by our business as much as a lot of it is inherent to the structure. Divisions, by their nature only see or appreciate what is relevant to their division as that is the direction the incentives are aligned. As you begin to understand the structures, cycles and challenges inherent in the chosen setup, it really helps you identify what can at times be difficult to understand without the framework on which to hang your view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange has been an (almost) daily companion for me in my day to day work as a developer. I could not count the number of times Stack Exchange has provided me with the answers I was looking for. Admittedly, I am more of a consumer, than a contributor (which is a subject for another post, another time). However, I did finally endeavour to post my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51373464/nodejs-error-listen-eaddrinuse-3000/52137477#52137477&quot;&gt;Answer&lt;/a&gt; this year. An incredibly minor achievement, and likely not worth a mention to most, but still, I feel like it&apos;s a step in the right direction! &lt;/p&gt;

Liferay is a Java-based CMS running a Postgres database, on an Apache Tomcat server and interestingly, Elasticsearch. I have previously setup a small Java microservice on Azure before and enjoyed the experience, so this has been an interesting exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, the decision we face is how to set the stack up. The options as I see them are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the application in a VM with a Bitnami Liferay image as well as an Elasticsearch image. I am not sure this will be cost-effective since the team is already under a lot of pressure and running their own stack within the VM might not be the best option. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manually&lt;/em&gt; set the stack up inside a VM, however, this may also be a challenge since the team is not experienced in devops culture and running what gets built. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a way to run the app inside an App Service with a managed instance of Postgres along with blob storage and a CDN. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still investigating the options, but I am excited about the possibilities and options for expanding my Azure knowledge further! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tips for writing Stack Exchange Job Posts Supported by Medium Posts.]]></title><description><![CDATA[My first Medium comment!  see here]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0043/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0043/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My first Medium comment! &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nicholaspretorius/hi-gijs-27df73d0c301&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Competencies Proficiency Scale.]]></title><description><![CDATA[How do you measure or represent your ability to do your job?

&lt;p&gt;In thinking through this question and reading up on some sources, I came across this page, which I think is a good frame from which to work. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hr.nih.gov/working-nih/competencies/competencies-proficiency-scale&quot;&gt;NIH Competencies Proficiency Scale&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, your proficiency is broken down into 5 levels: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Their words:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamental Awareness (basic knowledge) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a common knowledge or an understanding of basic techniques and concepts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novice (limited experience) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have the level of experience gained in the classroom or as a trainee. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are expected to need help performing this skill. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You understand and can discuss terminology, concepts, principles and issues related to this competency. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You utilize the full range of reference and resource materials in this competency. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate (practical application)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are able to successfully complete tasks in this competency as requested. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help from an expert may be required from time to time, but you can usually perform the skill independently. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have applied this competency to situations occassionally while needing minimal guidance to perform successfully. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced (applied theory)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can perform the actions associated with this skill without assistance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are certainly recognized within your immediate organization as a &quot;person to ask&quot; when difficult questions arise regarding this skill. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expert (recognized authority) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are known as an expert in this area. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can provide guidance, troubleshoot and answer questions related to this area of expertise and the field where the skill is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My words:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamental awareness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have watched a Udemy course or two on the topic and you can start to incorporate this into your own work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need to Google and Stack Exchange. A lot.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know enough to start. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can cobble things together, figure them out as you go but chances are good you will be spending a lot of time on things, that a more experienced developer will solve quite quickly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trial and error is a big part of your repertoire. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are primarily concerned with getting something to work rather than to work well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&apos;t know what you don&apos;t know. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your ability to read and comprehend code is limited. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can build stuff and you know enough to have opinions on what you have built (good and bad). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You refer more to the MDN and developer docs directly, because you are looking for the &lt;em&gt;gist&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You understand the building blocks and are looking for information that is more directional, than it is specific. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely, once you have built a few things, you will start to recognise the short-comings of your implementations and become more concerned with patterns, structure, efficiency and style. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importantly, you can, for the most part, solve your own problems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are becoming aware of what you don&apos;t know, you have pretty good ideas on what you need to get better at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know bad code when you see it, but you aren&apos;t thoroughly versed in how to improve it - you know it should be improved and you have some ideas to go on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have been round the block more than a few times. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can solve small problems quite quickly and most importantly, you can solve hard problems others are struggling with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your code is generally well structured, well written and hopefully shows good style. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People tend to call on you to help solve issues they are facing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know bad code when you see it and you immediately have solid suggestions and approaches to improving it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are solving problems most people don&apos;t even know exist. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are creating what everyone else uses. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are likely proficient in more than one language and could pick another up quickly. &lt;/li&gt;

First published on 2018/06/04. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some quickfire thoughts before WWDC gets on the go. Broadly, I think (or is that hope?) some big themes will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tucked or untucked?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big Siri improvements and announcements. (Will we see the new Siri chief?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widespread improvements and announcements for AR, Machine Learning and photo/video features (paving the way for new iPhones coming out later this year).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/35594/does-the-game-that-chewie-plays-with-r2-d2-have-a-name&quot;&gt;Dejarik&lt;/a&gt;&quot; AR demo - please! (The space chess game from Star Wars)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased security and encryption. As well as increased privacy controls and awareness (Trump/FBI and China proofing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased and improved Health features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will iTunes finally be split into multiple apps?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New apps and services to bolster the burgeoning &quot;Apple Services&quot; narrative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased iCloud storage tiers and options (iCloud TimeMachine anyone?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved/re-designed Mac App Store (not expecting Mac Pro updates just yet...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple TV news to lay foundations for whatever streaming plans Apple has.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple TV games announcements?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incremental improvements for Apple Maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any mentions of this possible MacOS/iOS platform unification?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HomePod love? (Now that AirPlay 2 and audio-pairing just got released - what next for HomePod)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fruits of the Workflow and Shazaam acquisitions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China, China, and more China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More diversity on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything faster and more battery efficient. (So that products later this year are as thin or thinner than ever).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra points for every mention of security, privacy, machine learning, AR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all wild guesses. As always, it will be exciting to see what is coming down the Apple pipes!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Swagger.yaml.]]></title><description><![CDATA[In my journey from front-end developer to full-stack developer, coming to grips with API creation and functionality is a major part of the…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0041/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0041/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In my journey from front-end developer to full-stack developer, coming to grips with API creation and functionality is a major part of the learning curve. Enter the Open API Specification and swagger.yaml.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don&apos;t know, Swagger, is not only a tool enabled by annotations to allow for browsing, testing and documentation of existing APIs. It also enables the design and specifications of APIs. Typically, writing working code is expensive and takes times. Discovering errors during and after creation are costly to the development process and good design can reduce and avoid these errors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, an API can be designed and documented via a .yaml (or .json) file. This file can then be displayed and interacted with via the Swagger UI to better design and visualise the API being created. Importantly, this .yaml file can be committed to a repo and shared with the team, which means it can be collaborated upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent the majority of the past few years working with completely undocumented APIs and more recently, having spent the better part of the last year working on a web application which consumes a third party API (poorly designed - in my opinion). I believe, I have become acutely aware of the following shortcomings in API design: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires manual testing (i.e. each API needs to be setup and tested manually through PostMan or Insomnia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorisation needs to be manually created each time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation (while pretty good) is separate from the above tooling. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API is unpredictable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the benefits of Swagger in terms of the first three points above have been clear to me for some time. By creating a .yaml file in conjunction with the SwaggerUI the real power of Swagger and the OpenAPI spec comes to the fore. You are now able to avoid the final point by thinking through the API, step by step, using the guidance and best practice of the Open API via the low cost and low impact of the .yaml file. One is then able to share and easily modify an API before a single line of code is written. As such, in the case of a team project, the architect or lead developer could design the API and then share it with the team in order to get feedback from the others. Being able to see the entire API as well as interact with it to some extent, allows the development team to better understand the scope and possible shortcoming of the desired implementation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to view and share these specifications means you can quickly and easily learn from other specs while designing and collaborating on your own spec. This spec can then, once ready to get started, be run through a mock generator to allow the front-end team to start working without having to wait for the backend developers to complete the API. Now that the API spec is known, both front and back-end developers have a contract against which to develop and more importantly, know what to expect! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in API spec are now more easily known and discoverable since the spec is committed to repo and can be included into the PR process. &lt;/p&gt;

First published on 2018/05/15. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-02/editor-in-chief-john-mickelthwait-on-new-bloomberg-redesign?utm_source=Memberful&amp;#x26;utm_campaign=0179ba35d2-daily_update_2018_05_14&amp;#x26;utm_medium=email&amp;#x26;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-0179ba35d2-110884453&quot;&gt;recent annoucement&lt;/a&gt; that Bloomberg has moved behind a metered paywall, I am starting to wonder at which point these subscription businesses start to combine and consolidate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One gets the feeling we are passing the early stage of the &lt;em&gt;digital subscription&lt;/em&gt; era and may soon, if not already, be moving into the digital subscription consolidation era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, subscriptions fall into categories or buckets. Each category has several contenders. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video - Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, Disney (still to come), Showmax etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music - Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Google/YouTube Music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio - Audible (and podcasts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education - Pluralsight, Lynda, Udacity, Udemy, MOOCs, The Great Courses etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News - The New York Times, Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The Guardian (donation based)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News niches - For example, in tech you have subscription newsletters such as Stratechery, Above Avalon and a few others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge for the contenders is that not all categories are equal and ultimately, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; subscriptions are competing for share of pocket. Some categories likely have space for a few subscriptions, while others have space for only one or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cutomer could foreseeably have space for 3 or 4 video services if you can/want to bear the cost. Since the content on the different -channels- subscriptions is highly differentiated and typically have block-buster &lt;em&gt;halo&lt;/em&gt; titles which are exclusive (i.e. Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, The Grand Tour etc) - there is more chance that people could justify a few video subscriptions. One could see the market settling into a pattern such as: Netflix as the de facto subscription, Amazon Prime Video in the second spot since it comes &lt;em&gt;bundled&lt;/em&gt; with Prime and then possibly a slot or two for HBO or Disney since they have the blockbuster, must-see content. Beyond that, niches may emerge to cater to specific interests such as anime or horror films. Even as I write this however, I suspect that 3 or 4 is likely too many. Maybe it will settle at only 1 or two?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It should be noted that the video space could be augmented by a purchase/rental model like iTunes - there are situations where someone may not want to subscribe monthly when they only want to watch one or two movies/titles once-off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In music, there can be only one. I doubt there are many people willing to pay for multiple music services (since the content is mostly identical - give or take a few &quot;exclusives&quot;), unless it was particularly niche - for example Primephonic for classical music. However, if you are a classical music fan, you may still only pay for one - the classical one! Music services do not have the same dynamics as the video subscriptions. If anything, the music subscriptions seem to be moving towards consolidation with a video service which may indicate many people do not want multiple subscriptions - they only want one for all their needs (TV bundle anyone?). For example, the Spotify/Hulu bundle as well as Apple&apos;s coming video entry which may or may not be bundled with Apple Music. From that perspective you could see a customer having their direct Netflix subscription for video, their Amazon Prime Video because it comes with Prime and then possibly Hulu because it is bundled with Spotify. As such, a customer has access to multiple video -channels- subscriptions while not necessarily paying directly for 3 video subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Audio (Audiobooks/podcasts)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to music, I think subscribers will only have space for one provider in the audiobook space (that is to say - if they even listen to audiobooks!). While there is currently a surge in the podcast industry, to date, podcasts are free and advertising supported. To my knowledge, there are not (yet?) subscription-specific podcasts. (The structure of the podcast industry seems most akin to the TV industry - in that they have networks hosting a variety of content in their stable, all supported by advertising)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to education, this depends heavily on what someone&apos;s interests or needs might be and whether that person values ongoing education. If they do value direct education, the next big question is whether they like to learn via video? In my own case, I think there will be more shifting or churn from one provider to another based on your specific work or education needs at the time. Similar to the video category (and it should be said - all these education sites are heavily focused on video), most providers are subscription based, while there is still a space for players like Udemy which sell individual courses (usually through sale pricing and 2 for 1 deals). This works nicely for my needs as I have a specific interest in programming (Pluralsight) and where I cannot find a topic on that platform, I can supplement it with a course or two from Udemy that deals with that specific topic. What is interesting to note here, is that popular teachers on Udemy are able to launch their own subscription based businesses off the back of the popularity/success on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted - niches are very strong in this field - Udacity is heavily pushing AI and machine-learning courses. A Cloud Guru is, as the name indicates, focused specifically on Amazon Web Services (and more recently Azure). There are smaller providers that focus on an even smaller niches for JavaScript libraries such as Angular (Ultimate Angular) or React (Tyler McGinnis) for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;News&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it comes to news. If we look back on the &quot;old model&quot; of paper-based subscriptions, people tended to subscribe to one or two newspapers. Typically their local paper and then possibly another national or even international paper. On top of that, someone may subscribe to a handful of magazines (maybe). I get the feeling there will be a similar trend for the news bucket. While subscription numbers will likely be good for the big brand names, this is not a business model many publications will be able to follow - especially because the customer&apos;s budget is spread between all of these services &lt;em&gt;regardless&lt;/em&gt; of category. Keep in mind, these same people are already paying for their other existing subscriptions in other categories. I might read Bloomberg articles quite frequently, however, I would not pay $39,99 a month for their content. As such, I am not their customer and that is OK for me, and OK for them. 120 articles a year (10 free articles a month) is likely more than enough for my own reading habits. The difficulty is that news cycles are not regular, news happens as it happens and thus 10 articles a month means little as a result. Someone may end up wanting to read more than 10articles in a particular month and then that same person may not read any at articles from the publication at all for months on end depending on where else they get their news (more on this below). While these big brand news outlets typically cover all areas, over time they are going to have to specialise in order so that customers can justify the cost of the subscription - especially if they have numerous subscriptions. Customers will not want to see the same stories and content rehashed across publications. The interesting thing will be to see how these focuses and niches start to play out between the big names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;News Niches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you get the specialised news and commentary. These publications are usually focused on a particular niche or a particular view/commentary on a niche. It is likely, that attention will be directed by these niches towards certain of the larger big name brands. For example, a tech publisher may direct traffic to particular sources based on their own subscription or reading habits. These publications usually act as filters or editorial on the news or what someone needs to know in their particular niche. In the tech space, one can get quite far in terms of knowing what events of importance are happening by following Stratechery (subscription) and a handful of (free) websites such as Daring Fireball. This means that possible subscriptions may be based on the subscription habits of your own &lt;em&gt;upstream&lt;/em&gt; subscriptions - for example, if Ben Thompson subscribes to publications X, Y, Z and frequently links to them - it is likely that his own readership may be moulded by his own subscriptions over time. How these moulds are set will be based on how the larger subscriptions themselves focus on or cover niches. In essence, there will be a doubling down on niches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a long-winded way of saying, as much as niche and digital subscriptions are unbundling the news/media bundle - this unbundling is inevitably leading to a re-bundling a little farther down the line.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Duplex Demo.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

First published on 2018/05/14. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018&quot;&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; an impressive and somewhat creepy version of a new feature coming to Google Assistant at Google I/O. Google Duplex, as the feature is called, is able to make a phone call and book an appointment at a hair salon and a table at a restaurant on behalf of the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The impressive part of this demonstration was how real the Google Assistant sounded as well as how well it handled the call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The creepy part of this was that the person on the receiving end of the phone call did not seem to notice that the caller was not a real person. (Had I answered that phone, I would not have thought it was a computer on the other side).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has raised several questions over the possible use and deployment of this technology. As is often the case, despite Sundar Pichai saying that Google wants to &quot;get this right&quot; in terms of the user experience for both customers and businesses - the demonstration displayed little attempt to address what many in the tech press feel should be required from this technology. Namely, transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Google&apos;s defence, they have said as much on the accompanying blog post announcing the technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html&quot;&gt;Yaniv Leviathan and Yossi Matias writing at the Google AI Blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Google Duplex technology is built to sound natural, to make the conversation experience comfortable. It’s important to us that users and businesses have a good experience with this service, and transparency is a key part of that. We want to be clear about the intent of the call so businesses understand the context. We’ll be experimenting with the right approach over the coming months. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this situation it is easy to see both Google and the tech press&apos;s positions on the demonstration - particularly, what Google means by transparency is that the receiver understands the intent of the call. What the press means by transparency is that the receiver knows who/what is making the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Google Duplex technology is built to sound natural&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commenters (myself included) feel that the Google Assistant should identify itself. Especially because it sounds natural and real. However, I sympathise with Google here because in order for a conversation to sound natural, the person on the receiving end needed to feel comfortable. Had the person been told they were speaking to Google Assistant or a robot, the conversation may have gone a lot differently and not demoed well. (Turing Test anyone?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for whether these kinds of assistants should even sound like humans at all, again, this would not have demoed well for Google because, it is likely that the person would have hung up the phone. Again, I sympathise with Google here because, from personal experience, when I get called by automated systems, I hang up immediately. The reality is that this is a demo and Google is demonstrating the prowess of their technology to both consumers and to competitors. What is being demonstrated is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look how natural it sounds!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look how well the assistant handles the call and the intricacies of it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look how far we have come!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google are aware of the impact such technology would have - the use cases are rather compelling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a business, I would certainly appreciate having to answer less calls during holiday periods and customers will appreciate having more up to date information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a customer, yes, I can see the benefit of an assistant making a call on my behalf when I am in a rush as being useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Google completely missed in the demo however, is that much of the subsequent negative commentary around the demonstration could be (at least somewhat) addressed by being more specific in terms of what is being experimented with. For example, would it not have made a difference to the tone of the subsequent reporting had Sundar Pichai said something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We understand this technology sounds like a real person and has progressed to the point at which it raises several questions in terms of usage. Some of the topics we are considering in our experiments are how to announce to the receiver of the call who is calling? Which voice should the assistant speak with in order to put the person on the on the receiving end at ease? And since this technology makes it possible to make many calls without humans making the actual calls, what large scale use cases are we going to enable so that customers are not spammed? We will be experimenting with this technology in the coming weeks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not work in PR, so I have no idea whether a statement such as the above would work. However, it does attempt to address the possible concerns raised by the use of this technology. Tech companies are going to be running into these situations more frequently as technology increasingly moves into more personal and &apos;real&apos; interactions. The tech press have their scopes locked in on these companies and their announcements. Executives should be able to effectively address the issues around their technologies before, during and after release in order to ensure success. Effective communication on these topics is important as these companies come under ever more scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parting thought:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Google Assistant can make the calls on behalf of the customer, can the business/customer not use the Google Assistant in the same way to answer them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, why is a call even necessary if there is an Assistant on both sides?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Node.js Testing with Mocha, Chai, Sinon and Istanbul.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unit tests seem to be like flossing - everyone says you should do it... but do you really?  Unit testing has been on my development todo…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0040/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0040/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Unit tests seem to be like flossing - everyone says you should do it... but do you really? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing has been on my development todo list for the past while and despite a few false starts, I have not really managed to get to grips with it. Today I decided to change all that and spent the day thrashing out some tests and here are some of my initial thoughts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First and foremost - you need to actually build something to be tested. For me, I started a new Node.js/Express API from scratch and completed a set of CRUD operations on a route with the goal being that would be one complete set of routes that needed to be tested in completion. A unit of units if you will. On to the details: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mocha is a test runner. That is to say, it is the frame upon which your tests hang. Mocha is the delivery guy to your pizza. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chai is a TDD/BDD style assertion framework. In English, it means you can write your tests in a natural-language-like syntax. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sinon is for spies, stubs and mocks. Basically, this means Sinon wholesale replaces segements of code in order to effectively test. Without Sinon you are basically doing integration tests. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Istanbul is a code coverage tool. This means, it compares your test code to your overall code and lets you know how much of your code is &apos;covered&apos; by tests. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with that out the way, you basically have 4x types of testing to my mind: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naive testing: This is what you &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; do day to day. Manually running your API tests in Postman/Insomnia or clicking through your application. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit testing is isolating a &apos;unit&apos; of your code and testing it alone without dependencies or by mocking these dependencies. The smaller the better. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration testing is basically taking parts of your application and testing them together. For example, when testing your API you are testing your routes with the database. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End-to-end testing is (hopefully) programmatically going through your application (not something I have covered yet - Selenium seems to be a widley used tool here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my path to testing has been driven primarily by need. Working on applications that run in multiple markets, with multiple configurations in the cloud means that with each new market or entity, you have one more application area to test, and it quickly gets out of hand when you are running UAT and Production environments with agile release schedules. As such, I have gotten to the point where I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; tests to back my team and I up when it comes to quality control. There just is not enough time to test every possible area with every code change and have the confidence you should that you have not broken something somewhere. While I am ashamed to admit it, I have been cowboy coding for far too long. Not cowboy cowboy, but the reality is that with the fast pace of development these days, one needs to have the following backups: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linting (to help you code better in the moment - more on this soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing (to help you help yourself after the moment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something to keep in mind when testing is to have a &apos;validation&apos; mindset. What I mean by that is, you need to be thinking about what you are testing with a hygenic mindset. Basically, if you have a round hole, you are specifying what fits in that round hole as well as specifying what does not fit. Essentially, you are being pedantic to some level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that does come to mind as one goes through this is that testing is not very straightforward. It is kind of obscure at times and seems strange to get your head around. But, even if you find it uncomfortable, stick with it, because, I think, even the process of going through this, and getting yourself to think about your code from a different perspective will on some level, improve your code regardless of how the tests go. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello Merge Commit.]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the spirit of reflection on the year passed.

It seems to me that while we are adopting agile, we are still very much in a waterfall mindset. I imagine it will take some time to move through this. In any event, the day was spent mostly working on estimates on unknowns far in advance. Something I wonder is how do developments teams trying to work agile quote for departments that expect waterfall? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very nature of providing a quote for work to be done, on a system to be built to completion for departments that have set budgets that they have to spend in a set amount of time with expectations of delivery of a highly specified product that looks good in a PowerPoint inevitably leads to waterfall. &lt;/p&gt;

First published on 2018/01/29. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Amazon does not have the presence in South Africa that it has overseas, personally, I have felt Amazon&apos;s presence beginning to expand in my day to day. This got me thinking of the incremental nature in which Amazon seem able to build its business. Slowly chipping away at the whole, adding to my monthly spend bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Audible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to Audible almost every day. Twice a day during the workweek to and from work and then on the weekend if I find myself driving somewhere on my own. Recently I have also started listening in between other things, like when getting ready for work, or when washing dishes and so forth. I am on the Gold monthly subscription which is $14.95 per month. I have been listening prolifically of late and have upped the speed of my listening to 1.25x. This has led me to start thinking about upgrading my subscription. We will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding 1.25x speed - I find this speed does not distort the reading much and after a few minutes sounds just right. Switching back to 1x speed I hardly notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IMDB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the IMDB app! It is on the home screen of my iPhone (as is Audible) and it sees a lot of usage. Despite this, there does not seem to be a pull into further Amazon activity like purchasing films. This is likely a barrier of delivery in that Amazon is not willing to sell via the App Store due to Apple&apos;s 30% cut and cannot link directly into their own store. And now, due to Amazon Prime Video being bundled with Prime, I suppose the push would only result in a one time purchase regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on the topic, I have recently been dying to see links, similar to the &quot;Cast and Crew&quot; links for both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The network that runs the show such as Netflix, Amazon, HBO, Hulu etc to get a list of all the available shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The production houses behind the films to get a list of the string of films they produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links to where to watch as I have recently struggled to find certain titles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Goodreads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently started recording my reading activity in Goodreads. I really enjoying taking a look through my Audible history and seeing what I have listened to in the past. I wanted a similar experience for my reading. Now, Goodreads does not seem able to provide the same stats that Audible does, but it at least keeps a measure of progress. I imagine there will be a much tighter coupling in Goodreads between what I browse and what I might purchase in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do wish I could log a start and end time of my reading session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not yet see a space with stats? It would be great to see stats on daily pages, average speeds etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a Prime subscriber, so to date, I have not watched any Amazon Prime Video content nor have I subscribed. However, I have installed the Apple TV app, and have browsed through it a few times. Recently, I have checked Amazon Prime Video on four separate occasions to see whether there was content available that I could not find on Netflix and iTunes. Had the films in question been available there, it is likely I would have signed up. As such, it is just a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, the three films I was looking for were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hacksaw Ridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cabin in the Woods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Escape from New York&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until a few weeks ago I had never bought anything on Amazon. However, as a result of some resolutions I made, I was looking to buy some programming books. I had made an attempt at reading them online, but while I read a lot online, long form content is not something I do well with on my phone. It almost all exclusively RSS feeds, blog posts and articles. Since these books were not available in Exclusive Books or on Takealot, I figured I should try Amazon. The waiting period has been about 2-3 weeks due to international shipping, but if you plan your purchasing ahead, it works out really well. So far I have bought 3x programming books, 3x cookbooks, a non-fiction book as well as a book for my father. The ease of this process and the way the Amazon app keeps you right up to date with the detailed progress of your order has made it a really good experience. One that I am already planning on repeating soon. Now, it is only a matter of time until that Amazon Prime subscription raises its head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date: 1 delivery was late by about 2-3 days. The other was a week early!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and maybe not least, is Amazon Web Services. To date, I have never used Amazon Web Services in a development capacity. However, since using Azure at work, I have become a keen learner on the topic of cloud services for development and I imagine that, once again, it is only a matter of time until I dip my toe in the AWS waters to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, despite not having much of a direct presence in my life (until recently) is slowly, but surely carving out niches in my day-to-day usage as well as my month-to-month spend. No doubt this effect has been a lot more drastic for many years in markets such as the USA, UK and Europe, but it does bear thinking about. That the long, slow game, with the right products and strategy can shave off more and more of the share of wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Audible Sidenote:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Audible, however the more I think about it, the Gold/Platinum structure of the membership levels seem positively outdated. Paying $14.95 a month for a single credit seems almost archaic in comparison to today&apos;s Netflix-style all you can eat subscriptions. I subscribe to the Netflix Dual Screen subscription as well as the Apple Music Family Plan and both of these offer unlimited use on multiple devices. It seems to strange to have a relatively &quot;expensive&quot; subscription which allows you only 1 credit and (what amounts to) 1 device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, I still believe Audible is fair. Even listening as much as I do, one credit a month more or less works out perfectly. I do not find myself without credits, and more often than not, I find myself playing catch-up. The thing is, a lot of thought goes into that credit. I actually look forward to browsing, evaluating, planning and choosing my purchase this way. I tend to be calculated and measured in my selections.  Though I hate to say it, listening time definitely has a big impact on my choices. I seldom select a book under 15 hours of listening time. The reality is that, while there may be thousands of really good short books out there that I want to listen to, but with only 1 credit a month, it a waste to spend it on a short book. I think this is where, I wish Amazon had a little more play in their Audible offering since the only options are 12 or 24 titles on subscription. In the same breath, it is great that a book that is 80 hours can be had for the same amount as a book of 6 hours. But still, going short feels like missing out, and as a result, there are many quality titles that I likely will not listen to as a result. I get the feeling that had Amazon not had such a firm grip on the audiobook market, this &quot;restrictive&quot; approach to subscriptions may have proven to be a potential weak spot to be used as an attack mechanism. Alas, this does not seem to be the case. I have started to look around at alternatives to Audbile however, the search is early and my decisions are slow to build when it comes to purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, two of those alternatives, not surprisingly are from Amazon itself. Bundled Audible as a benefit of Amazon Prime as well as the Kindle Unlimited deal which bundles Kindle books along with their Audible companions with Whispersync. Both fall short (by design I am sure) since the selections in both are so limited. Having experienced, what I find to be, quite uninspired selections in the Audible 2 for 1 sales, I have no intention of limiting my choices to either 50 rotating titles from Audible or to the large, but still limited set of audio titles available on Kindle Unlimited. (On that note, I have never used a Kindle and when I have read books on my iPhone, that has been via iBooks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Uber and UberEats:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a similar feeling when it comes to Uber. For quite some time, Uber had been slowly increasing in usage in my own life. Then when UberEats launched, my girlfriend and I started using it now and then to order in. This also got me to thinking about how companies, by satisfying jobs to be done, slowly start shaving off pocket share in other markets and from competitors. Personally, I think it is a hugely effective approach for companies with the kind of scale that makes the approach viable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pre-HomePod.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

First published on 2018/01/25. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the anticipation surrounding the soon to be released HomePod is more centred around a desire to tear it down and declare Amazon Echo or Google Home to be the winner in the expanding voice assistant category than it is for the actual anticipation of the product. Once the reviews drop, we can expect plenty of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is too expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Siri is worse than Alexa/Assistant/Cortana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot do X, Y or Z on HomePod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sound isn&apos;t as good as X, Y, Z.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple is doomed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I will be looking forward to reading about (and eventually hearing) how good of speaker it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 years ago I bought a JBL Charge 3 for my girlfriend. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made. It sounds good, it&apos;s portable, the battery lasts a good while and it is even waterproof. One thing it is not, is smart or have a voice. While the JBL Charge 3 is great, I am looking for something a little more permanent to pair with the Apple TV in the lounge while the JBL Charge 3 can go in the bedroom or go with us on holiday. As far as I am concerned, any smart/voice features are all upside. The jobs to be done in my case are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio for video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not underestimate the value of a good speaker. The real test will be to see how HomePod compares to higher end speakers and audio systems. It is interesting to consider HomePod not as an over-priced, under-featured voice assistant, but rather as a low-end entrant to the high-end audio market.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sprint 1 Retrospective.]]></title><description><![CDATA[We finish our first sprint tomorrow.

As explained earlier this week, we are running a 1 week sprint since we are a small team. I completed all my issues this afternoon, so I think it makes for a good time to reflect on the week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, our application sits on top of a third party API and application. As such we are reliant on that third party doing there part when it comes to config. As such, when doing rollouts, our tasks have a direct dependency on third party completion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In future, we need the third party config complete the Friday before we include that work into the sprint. Otherwise time is spent &quot;waiting&quot;. This puts testing under pressure. For example, we only received our config this morning (Thursday). That means I had to do my bit, test and push it to both UAT and &quot;pre-live&quot; rapidly. This is all well and good, but it put our tester under pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only scoped half my time for the week towards development, since the config and testing was estimated at 10 hours (primarily because we often run into config issues which take some time iron out). The remainder was left open in case we got access to our new market&apos;s setups and would require testing on my party to confirm all was in order. As a result, I pushed and worked on stories that were not in the sprint but in the backlog. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope in some of the trickier features next sprint. We have an important few weeks coming up as the app will be setup, tested and released in 3 Arabic markets with a bi-lingual front-end as well as right-to-left layout. The team doing config that side is new to the product, so we may be in for some &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate time towards filling out our Confluence pages and getting our clients involved in the process in a more hands-on fashion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the technical side, the WebJob which is setup to automatically renew the Let&apos;s Encrypt SSLs was generating the SSLs using a -staging flag and a &quot;fake&quot; certificate. I need to investigate next week and resolve it. Fortunately I was able to quickly regenerate these accordingly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good first sprint. We hit our goals (though we underscoped slightly) and there are areas for improvement. I am excited to see how we do next week!  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[About Those Apple Supply Chain Rumours.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

&lt;p&gt;Mike Wuerthele wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://appleinsider.com/articles/18/01/19/if-iphone-x-demand-is-less-than-expected-analyst-expects-it-to-be-end-of-life-when-replacements-ship&quot;&gt;article at AppleInsider&lt;/a&gt; about a KGI Securities research note regarding the iPhone X titled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If iPhone X demand is less than expected, analyst expects it to be &apos;end of life&apos; when replacements ship&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;internet&quot; then decided that this meant the iPhone X would be cancelled due to weak sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is to read Wuerthele&apos;s article from bottom to top for a better understanding of what KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo is actually saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyst expects trio of iPhone models in 2018 with possible launch of iPhone X Plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current iPhone X is unlikely to be retained in line-up once replaced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notch may be affecting impact in China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shipments of 18 million iPhone Xs expected in Q1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No comment on holiday sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyst expects 10% iPhone growth in 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firm remains positive on the Apple and the iPhone supply chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Roman Raphaelson book on writing. Read it three times. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the way you talk. Naturally. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never use jargon words like &lt;em&gt;reconceptualize&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;demassification&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;attitudinally&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;judgmentally&lt;/em&gt;. They are hallmarks of a pretensious ass. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never write more than two pages on any subject. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check your quotations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never send a letter or memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning - then edit it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want ACTION, don&apos;t write. Go and tell the guy what you want. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, workplace email culture often fails dismally on points: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Assumptions.]]></title><description><![CDATA[As the saying goes "Assumptions are the mother of all ^*&#-ups".

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty, at least in building software, is that the specific assumptions we may have differ from project to project. These assumptions are often difficult to spot ahead of time. Many may be cut from similar cloth, but one tends to discover that assumptions get dressed up in different disguises. Almost inevitably, it is our assumptions gone wrong that takes us most by surpise and leave us feeling most confounded since they seem so obvious in hindsight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we do to spot those deviously disguised assumptions and prevent their antics? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite our better judgements, we often tend to assume things will go well. All I can say is that you need to acknowledge that this a highly unlikely situation. Before you even knew it, you have made your first and worst assumption. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a note of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that your are looking at your plan in a new light. Take a look at those dates you have in mind and ask yourself and your team what leads you to expect that X, Y and Z will happen when you think it will? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write the reasons down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of those expectations you have, consider that they are actually assumptions. Now take another look at that list. Suddenly you start to realise how easy it is to be lead astray by assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, ask and answer the following questions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would cause X, Y and Z &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to happen? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on those answers, then ask what can be done in order to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Avoid each one of these happening at all? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. If we cannot avoid it, what can be done to mitigate the chance of it happening? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. If it can&apos;t be mitigated, what can be done to recover from, or reduce the impact of, it happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do those things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it can be difficult to see our blindspots and assumptions at all times, I do believe that by asking these questions, we can at least begin to better indentify the assumptions, that while obvious in hindsight, often sneak up on us unawares and catch us napping.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple 2018.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

First published on 2018/01/22. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of some speculative fun, here are my guesses at what Apple may or may not do in 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is going to be fascinating to see what Apple does with the iPhone line in 2018. 2017 introduced 3 models: iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. What happens with the traditional &apos;S&apos; cycle upgrade since being upturned by the latest release cycle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally Apple does not introduce new form factors in the &apos;S&apos; cycle (last year being the exception) and this cycle is traditionally focused on software-based introductions and improvements. Does this mean we will see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone XS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone 8S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone 8S Plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone SE (with iPhone 7 internals).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New battery case (Has anyone noticed Marty Bird&apos;s continual use of the battery case in Ozark?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be fascinating to see what Apple does in 2019 to the &quot;old&quot; iPhone form factor. Depending on how the iPhone 8/X sales go, might we see the &quot;old&quot; form factor kept as the low-cost option, or will it fall away completely? On that note, I suspect 2019 will see the release of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone X (What will it be called? iPhone X2?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will we see a dual-camera iPhone X?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone X Plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Pencil integration for iPhone X Plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will happen to the notch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The race to a fully-full-screen phone is on and there are big questions around how to solve for the front-facing camera and sensors in order to achieve this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AirPods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New AirPods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New colours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pricing of new vs old AirPods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another interesting AirPods question is when will we see &quot;low-end&quot; AirPods in the box with new iPhones? (Could this be on the cards as the product line matures and the components move down the cost curve making EarPods-level AirPods &apos;Lite&apos; possible?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suspect the AirPods serve as a successful up-sell, so providing AirPods in the box might cannibalise &quot;high-end&quot; AirPods so we may see the form factor remain constant for a while. Maybe there is space to incorporate the AirPods price into the iPhone as iPhone price pushes upwards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do AirPods remain a single form-factor product line? Does Apple widen the product offering to include on or over-ear headphones that compete with Beats?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we will see cellular connectivity in the AirPods?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iPad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the raft of iPad updates in 2017, will Apple continue this story in 2018?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPad with iPhone X-like bezel-less design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPad with FaceID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New (smaller) Apple Pencil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved iPad keyboards/cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What of these MacOS/iOS combination rumours?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always-on time (&apos;Finally&apos; becoming a &apos;real&apos; watch.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suspect there will be one more year of the current form-factor before a thinner Apple Watch in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or do we see a new form-factor this year and always-on remains a hanging fruit? (Apple must be itching to get a thinner Watch out there! Would likely be a good push on the upgrade cycle. Especially considering all those health-insurance subsidised watches out there.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When (if ever) does Apple breakout Apple Watch numbers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HomePod&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release within Q1?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And what of Siri integration?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Siri&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking forward to many improvements as Siri is now under Craig Federighi (along with iOS, MacOS, TvOS and WatchOS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-lingual support is an area Apple can claw back on the &quot;Amazon Echo&quot; lead. The presence of smart speakers in non-English markets is still in the very early to non-existent stages it seems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mac Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the Mac Pro see the light of day in 2018 as announced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And what about those external monitors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big questions around form factor? (To avoid thermal corners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MacBook and MacBook Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will we see regular spec bumps in order to avoid the very long upgrade cycles and ever-rising (but currently relatively dormant) Mac criticisms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens to the TouchBar? (Does Apple keep it (surely?) and continue to maintain two lines of MacBook Pro?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What more will we find out about the MacOS/iOS combination? ARM-based Macs? LTE Macs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased usage of T-series processors (and other Apple silicon) across the Mac range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HomePod, Mac Pro and MacBook/Pro release and upgrade cycles will come under scrutiny. Apple has made announcements and commitments to these and already the HomePod is slipping. Will be keeping an eye here to see if the others slip too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phil Schiller&apos;s leadership of the App Store has resulted in great improvements to the iOS App Store. When will we see the fruits of his leadership come to the Mac App Store?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dolby Atmos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved remote (Likely only in 2019 with new Apple TV hardware).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game controller? (Likely only paired with new hardware. If ever.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone other than Gene Munster think there will be an actual Apple TV TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple Video and Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch of first batch of Apple streaming video series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvement of Apple Music interface and recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shazam integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iCloud&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved iCloud free and paid tiers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streamlining of iCloud features - the iCloud authentication and password flows still seem horribly touchy and strange to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Project Titan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens with CarPlay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More rumours... leaks? (Likely that those leaks will only start in earnest once the supply chain comes into play.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other areas of interest will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the majority of the work on Apple Campus and the Apple Stores seems to be done, where will Jony Ive be exerting his focus?What will be revealed about Apples US plans in terms of campuses, hiring, cash and tax repatriation?What effect will moving to the new campus have on the employees and their work?Will Apple be able to batten down the hatches in terms of public and somewhat embarrassing bugs?Come what may, it is going to be an exciting year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 23/01/2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple have announced that HomePod will be available in Apple Stores in US, UK and Australia on 9 Feb. Multi-room audio, stereo pair and AirPlay2 will however only be added in future software updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jira Sundry.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Our team has very recently begun using Jira.

&lt;li&gt;Our team has very recently begun using Jira. Our current setup is that we have a Backlog (Kanban style) and a Sprint board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week is our first sprint and will run for one week with Retrospective and Sprint Planning on Fridays. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our basic flow is this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scoped, groomed and prioritised stories are moved from Backlog to Active Sprint. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our sprintboard has 4 columns To Do, In Progress, In Test, Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To Do and In Progress are self-explanatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Test means that once the Definition of Done is reached, the developer will release to the UAT environment so that testing can begin. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the tester is happy, the story is moved to Done. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since our project relies on a 3rd party API and frequent support thereof or therearound, we have an Epic for the third party. As such, any items that are waiting for their response/input/feedback are put into that epic. Once resolved/responded, the issues is moved back into play. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory, this means that our Project Lead only needs to keep an eye on this Epic in terms of follow-up with the third party. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the third party uses a separate board called Teamwork, all communication with them is logged there with the link to that thread added to the issue so that the thread can be followed in full there. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it comes to testing, we are using HP ALM as per company standard, however, since we are a small team, we are looking to experiment with X-Ray, the Jira add-on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While most of our prior project communication is tied up in the MS Office rabbit hole of Outlook, Excel, Word, PowerPoint and share drives, I am doing my best to move as much of the development relevant information to Confluence. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All our project code was moved into Git and BitBucket in October/November last year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be using Confluence&apos;s Meeting Notes pages for our meeting memos. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of the structure of our stories, this is still in early stage, but since we do a lot of config/rollout tasks, we settled on having User Stories for TEST and LIVE config on both the technical and development/server side. Each story then has a Checklist. The first person in the chain assigns the task to themselves using &quot;Assign to me&quot; and moves the story into In Progress. Once complete with their items on the checklist, they assign the story to the next person in the chain. When they are done, they moved the story to In Test and assign the story to the tester. Once the tester is happy, it gets moved to Done. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We originally tried to use Tasks and sub-tasks for this, but this proved to be one hand too much overhead (creating stories with checlists is far easier and quicker) and our corporate decided workflow means that Tasks cannot be moved to In Test. As such, we stick to checklists inside stories for config. Only items that truly are &quot;tasks&quot; that do not require testing are created as &quot;Tasks&quot;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we have defects which will go where they are found. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a daily stand-up following the routine of &quot;What I did yesterday? What I did today? Impediments?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On that note, we have no Business Analyst (BA) or designer on the team, so many of the user stories need to be written by yours truly. I have little to no experience or trainig on this, so Google is my friend. It also means, I tend to create a lot of my own stories and issues, which, I don&apos;t think is really a good thing, but there you have it! Small teams need to multi-task! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Taking Stock.]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have been pushing myself hard since November of last year to one again revisit my skills as a developer.

Setting high goals with a demanding schedule and uncertain circumstances has been a challenge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can be a struggle to reach these goals. Since one learns more, one realises how much more there is to learn. It feels at times, that I am not entered into a race as much as a triathlon: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving my skills as a JavaScript developer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning Node.js to add backend JavaScript skills to my repertoire. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning cloud and server managments in order to better adopt the devops role I now play. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all of these, trying to improve as colleague, teammate and human being overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have no doubt that my skills are improving, some days, I feel as if progress has ground to a halt. One starts to focus on the gap between what is, and where one wants to get to. In that light, I thought it time to reflect on some of what I have learned about in the past year: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become the lead (and for 95% of the time) only developer on a small but growing, international project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built a multi-lingual, multi-directional interface (LTR - RTL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taken responsiblity for the hosting and management of hosting for the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned/learning to use Git daily after using Subversion for many years. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Atlassian tools such as BitBucket, Jira and Confluence daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning Azure and working hard to upskill myself in devops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning Node.js in order to deliver backend JavaScript functionality and APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned Sketch in order to mockup/design interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying React in order to see what is out there other than AngularJS. (Angular, TypeScript, Unit Testing... all the things still to come)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned to navigate my way around Linux, generating CSRs/SSLs, getting increasingly comfortable with the command line. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented app and server updates in order to meet Penetration/Security Test criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent some time learning Java in order to get a better handle on the language, environment and mindset the larger company works in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopting Agile in project and team work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming increasingly efficient on a Mac (after a lifetime of Windows usage).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working remotely. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking reponsibility, ownership and trying to improve my work in general. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a mountain to climb and most likely a further mountain range behind it. Here&apos;s to the journey, more than the destination! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rabbit Holes.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Late last year I resolved to unlearn and relearn my skills as a developer.

While I have done this at various points in my career, what was important to me this time round was to write about it. To put what I learn and some of my thoughts around the topic on the internet. Regularly. And to learn a whole lot of new things along the way. For the past month or so, I have kept to it. Almost daily. However, since Thursday night last week, like Alice into Wonderland, I found myself heading down a rabbit hole into a collection of strange errors and poor choices. I am still not quite sure I am out of the rabbit hole, but at least I am putting a post out there! So where to begin? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site, has been developed on a MacBook Pro Retina 13-inch late 2012 model, with a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB of memory and 120GB of storage. Up until I bought this machine a few years back, I had only ever worked on Windows machines. The company I work for uses Windows exclusively, except for two iOS developers. As such, I am a Windows-user by day, and Mac user by night. Due to my travels and several relocations over the past few years, I have not had a continuous, fast internet connection, often relying on mobile data via mifi hotspots, wifi or whatever internet may be available where I am staying at any particular time. As such, on both my iPhone and MacBook Pro, I have never configured continous backups to iCloud or any other service like that. Hand in hand with these same travels and movements, my photo collection has expanded rapidly over the same time period and space has become a rare commidty on this machine. To the point that, actively managing the meagre space I have left over after Photos has become an almost daily chore. I am greeted with modals telling my memory is full or near to it, multiple times a night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very same time, as this site may indicate, I have been learning Node.js, Express and Azure and eventually wound my way to MongoDB. Which, in turn, lead me to the crux of the matter. In order to install MongoDB on a Mac, you use Homebrew. When installing MongodDB via Homebrew, I was rather unceremoniously informed that my XCode was out of date. Considering I hardly ever use XCode, I decided to be done with it and removed it completely. Because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned, I do not use XCode. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XCode takes a lot of space and removing it would free up a scarce resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XCode Command Line Tools are available as a separate install, which, for the most part, means Homebrew can run smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... it was not to be. Despite cleaning up my brewery according to brew doctors helpful recommendations. Installing XCode Command Line Tools brought no respite. The brew install mongodb command informed me, no, I need the full XCode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn. Enough was enough. After some grumblings to my own self along the lines of &quot;Why the %^&amp;#x26;$ would MongoDB REQUIRE a full XCode?&quot;, I took a breath and reflected on what I could learn from this experience? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to free up space on my machine so I can continue working without losing my memory management mind. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really do need to backup my Photos and other files to the cloud (a single external HD is not enough!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The obstacle is the path. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Backup Blaze&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to backup all my Photos and videos to iCloud. Easier said than done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running into some strange iCloud username and password scenarios and it getting late after a long day, I decided to drop iCloud and find out whether all these good things I hear about Backblaze are true? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I signed up for the Trial Period and started backing up. After following the link saying &quot;How long will my backup take?&quot; How long indeed I wondered?
Answer: Twenty. Five. Days! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this ADSL connection runs at more or less 7-9 Mbps download and hovers in the region of 1-2 Mbps upload. Not exactly Speedy Gonzalez. Helpfully, Backblaze said I can continue using my laptop as normal...
Not quite. When your connection is not that fast to begin with (even slower during peak-evening times) and your laptop periodically loses wifi signal when it sleeps... Well, I am 7 days into my backup and to be honest, I have no idea if it is closer to being done or further way from being done. On Saturday Backblaze said there were only about 9000 files left, and today there are apparently over 18000 left. So what&apos;s a guy to do Backblaze? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my resolution to learn new things, is, due to my limited time after hours, made up of watching and coding along with tutorial videos which I (usually) stream at around 1.5x speed. This helps me see other coders work, code along, struggle and learn in an accerlated environment. With my backup happening, this slowed to a crawl since streaming video was now more like a stuttering/buffering contest than anything. Listening to a continually buffering video is a sure way to lose your mind and patience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, my past few work days have included less coding/problem solving than I usually do. We are busy onboarding a new tester and this highlighted the fact that our Confluence pages were woefully underpopulated and our Jira workflows needed some revisiting. Alongside this, I was mostly preparing, testing and revising some existing code and functionality for a release this week. As such, the &quot;Today I Learned&quot; side of things has been somewhat underpopulated in terms of pure code and tech the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, there is a lot more I can write about than just code snippets, commands and steps. I decided however, that since it was the weekend, and since my machine had a lot of backing up to do, I would take a break. Curiously, on Monday, after getting home quite late and performing my ritual &quot;Backblaze Progress Check&quot; I tried to open Chrome and get coding again. Chrome would not open. As in, click to open Chrome. Nothing happens. Maybe Backblaze is hogging up some resource Chrome uses. Onto Safari. It opens. Sweet! Type in a URL and... Safari closes. No crash. Just. Closes. Every. Time. Being Monday and being late I decided to leave it to another day. Come Tuesday, and we are gearing up for a release Wedneday, so work turns into a long day and I decide to just leave it one more day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is how you lose your habits! The same way you build them. One day at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be vigilant with your breaks from habit! No matter how small, and for what reasons. This is how you go from daily, to weekly, to monthly, to your annual &quot;New Year&apos;s Resolution&quot;. If you go down the rabbit hole. Take a moment to stop and reflect on how and why you ended up there before burrowing even further. If not, at least write about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why does installing MongoDB require the installation of XCode? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Before you say &apos;Hold on there buddy! You can run Homebrew on X Code&apos;s standalone Command Line Tools.&apos;. Yes, I know. And no, not always. Yes, I successfully installed, for example, the Azure CLI via brew with &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; the Command Line Tools installed. However, when trying for brew install mongodb I was told explicitly by brew that the standalone tools were not enough. It makes little sense to me that I need to install a 9-10GB application in order to install MongoDB. Why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is iCloud Keychain so complicated? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
After numerous attempts and combinations of password resets, signing in with AppleID password, then laptop password, then SMS verification code and then some strange 6 digit &apos;iPhone&apos; passcode (which was not my iPhone&apos;s passcode) continually failed despite me entering verification codes generated from my iPhone. I eventually managed to get in with the details it had to date been failing with. How? I have no idea. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we come to Azure Portal. Now, I have been using Azure at work and been experimenting with it at home and I have noticed on several occassions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have had to have my Azure password at work reset at least twice because, for some strange reason, Azure sometimes signs out and then seemingly will not allow you to sign back in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to this, when you do sign out, Azure often asks you to close the window - why? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, today, after signing out of my Azure account this morning, when I returned this evening, Azure informed me my account was temporarily suspended due to suspicious activity and that I need to send an SMS code to my phone to re-activate. Firstly - what suspicious activity? I was not even signed in. Secondly - when sending the SMS, the loading spinner just spun and spun and spun... &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;npm i busboy azure-storage --save&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your Express Generator app/controllers/home.js: (Note that this is just a basic example without login)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    ...
    const Busboy = require(&apos;busboy&apos;);
    const blobStorage = require(&apos;../services/blobStorage&apos;);
    ...
    router.post(&apos;/upload&apos;, function(req, res) {

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In blobStorage.js | Note, you should not hardcode your details like this, they should be retrieved from Azure directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    process.env[&apos;AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT&apos;] = &apos;your-storage-name&apos;;

&lt;li&gt;When deploying Node.js to Azure, the default entry file is server.js. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to set the port in your app to something like: const port = process.env.port || 8000; so that Azure can use it&apos;s preferred port. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 ways to setup up Node.js on Azure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a Virtual Machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an App Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Azure Virtual Machines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual Machine: In the Azure Portal, select &apos;Virtual machines&apos; and follow the prompts: e.g. Ubuntu, SSD + SSH public key for authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In iterm2/terminal: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2084&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember your passphrase if you set one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once setup: ssh username@IP.ADD.RES.S &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had trouble using a non-standard key, as such, I ended up using the default: rsa_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once logged in, run: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run: nodejs -v to check your version and if all is well.
*On your local, install the Azure CLI via Homebrew: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
brew update 
brew install azure-cli
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few commands to get you started: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
az -h 
az vm -h
az login
az stop
az deallocate
az start
az account set --subscription your-subcription-name
az vm list --output-table
az vm deallocate --name your-vm-name --resource-group your-resource-group
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then setup Local Git as a deployment source to Azure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
cd your-project
git init
git add .
git commit -m &apos;First commit&apos;
git add remote azure http://the-azure-git-url.git
git push azure master
az webapp browse --name your-app-name --resource-group your-resource-group 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that is done, you can setup deployment slots as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
az webapp -h
az webapp deployment slot swap --slot your-slot-name --name your-app-name --resource-group your-resource-group-name
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Azure App Service&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;az group create --location &apos;location-name&apos; --name your-app-service-name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;az appservice plan create --name your-app-service-name --resource your-resource-name --sku FREE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;az webapp create --name your-app-name --resource-group your-resource-group-name --plan your-plan-name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name your-app-name --resource-group your-resource-group-name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then connect your add your Azure git remote, add/commit and push. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Azure, Node.js, PowerShell.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Check the OS and architecture in PowerShell:  2 Ways to check which version of Node is running on Azure:  Open the Kudu Console (via…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0027/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0027/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the OS and architecture in PowerShell: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    wmic os get caption
    wmic os get osarchitecture
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Ways to check which version of Node is running on Azure: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Kudu Console (via Advanced Tools, CMD) and run: node -v or npm -v&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Azure Portal, in the App Service blade, in Application Settings look for:                     &lt;pre&gt;
WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Ways to specify the Node.js version to run in Azure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In package.json set the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    &quot;engines&quot;:{
        &quot;node&quot;: &quot;0.6.22 || 0.8.x&quot;
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the &apos;node_env&apos; by changing the value mentioned above in Application settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set &apos;node_env&apos; in your web.config in the system.webServer block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    &amp;lt;system.webServer&amp;gt;
        ...
        &amp;lt;iisnode node_env=&quot;production&quot; /&amp;gt;
        ...
    &amp;lt;/system.webServer&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set it via the iisnode.yml file | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode/blob/master/src/samples/configuration/iisnode.yml&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Note: The web.config or iisnode.yml values will override the value in Application Settings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first article above introduced me to Swaggerize, which, via a Yo generator, lets you generate boilerplate code for your API via a Swagger.json document specifying your routes. It will then also setup the Swagger UI for you to enable testing. Very cool! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/swaggerize-express&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, when working with GitHub or Azure via a proxy, remember to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    git config --global http.proxy http://proxyuser:proxypassword@proxy.server.domain:port
    git config --global --unset http.proxy
    git config --global --get http.proxy
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nodemailer-express-handlebars is a useful plugin for Nodemailer that allows you to use Handlebars templates in your HTML emails | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yads/nodemailer-express-handlebars&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
The documentation on that page does not provide a full usage example and is really short on details. I then found this article which was incredibly helpful! | &lt;a href=&quot;http://excellencenodejsblog.com/express-nodemailer-sending-mails/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
...
var hbs = require(&apos;nodemailer-express-handlebars&apos;);
var options = {
viewEngine : {
    extname: &apos;.hbs&apos;, // handlebars extension
    layoutsDir: &apos;views/email/&apos;, // location of handlebars templates
    defaultLayout: &apos;template&apos;, // name of main template
    partialsDir: &apos;views/email/&apos;, // location of your subtemplates aka. header, footer etc
},
viewPath: &apos;views/email&apos;,
extName: &apos;.hbs&apos;
};
...
mailer.use(&apos;compile&apos;, hbs(options));
mailer.sendMail({
from: &apos;test@test.com&apos;,
to: req.body.to,
subject: req.body.subject,
template: &apos;template&apos;,
context: {
    firstName: req.body.firstName,
    lastName: req.body.lastName,
    ...
}
}, function(error, response)...) 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of my day was then spent trying to figure out how best to put Node.js, Express and its dependencies into a working app via Webpack. I have not been very successful so far... My main issue at present is that when I run Webpack I get a lot of errors that say things like: Module not found: Error: Can&apos;t resolve &apos;./decode/&apos; etc &lt;br/&gt;
I did however, find two articles which look promising and that I will be picking for clues:

This is a great article, however, he uses Grunt to build his TypeScript which is not quite what I am looking for. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TypeScript, ExpressJS API with Webpack | &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Pierre_anthill/typescript-expressjs-api-with-webpack-4655126d884b&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

res.header(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;, &quot;*&quot;);
res.header(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot;, &quot;Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;);
next();
});
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To use req.body inside of Express you need to load Body Parser | &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10005939/how-do-i-consume-the-json-post-data-in-an-express-application/10007542#10007542&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First install it: npm i body-parser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var express = require(&apos;express);
var bodyParser = require(&apos;body-parser&apos;);
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;var app = express();&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;app.use(bodyParser.json());&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;app.post(&apos;/&apos;, function(req, res) {
console.log(req.body);
})
app.listen(8000);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* In package.json check: &quot;main&quot;: &quot;app.js&quot;, then you can just run: nodemon instead of: nodemon app.js
* npm i pug --save
* mkdir view &amp;&amp; cd_$
* touch index.pug
* Then:
&lt;pre&gt;
    app.set(&apos;view engine&apos;, &apos;pug&apos;);
    ..
    app.get(&apos;/&apos;, (req, res) =&gt; {
        res.render(&apos;index&apos;, {title=&apos;Hello world!&apos;});
    });
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Pug templating 101 (Assume we have var colors = [&apos;red&apos;, &apos;blue&apos;, &apos;green&apos;])
&lt;pre&gt;
    doctype html
    html(lang=&quot;en&quot;)
        head
            title= title
        body
            div.wrapper
            .content
            ul

                   li color
            p#main Hi!
            #secondary
            if hint 
                p
                    i Hint: #{hint}
            else 
                p (There is no hint)
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Pug locals
&lt;pre&gt;
    app.get(&apos;/cards&apos;, (req, res) =&gt; {
        res.locals.prompt = &quot;What is your question?&quot;;
        res.locals.hint = &quot;Think about something.&quot;; // interpolated from #{hint} above
        res.render(&apos;card&apos;);
        // res.render(&apos;card&apos;, {prompt: &apos;What is your...&apos;, hint: &apos;Think about...&apos;});
    });
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Pug Partials &lt;br/&gt;
In the layout.pug file (along with a: mkdir includes)
&lt;pre&gt;
...
header 
    include includes/header.pug
...
block content
...
    include includes/footer.pug
&lt;/pre&gt;
In the index.pug file: 
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;block content
section#wrapper
h1 Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 4: Data Structures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost all JavaScript values have properties except null and undefined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value.prop prop must be a valid variable name and directly names the propery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value[prop] prop is &lt;strong&gt;evaluated&lt;/strong&gt; to get the property name. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The elements of an array are stored in properties with numbers for their names. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properties that contain functions are called methods. Examples are .toUppercase, .toLowerCase for strings. Array have pop(), push(), .join() amongst others. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can delete an object property with: delete object.propertyName;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;console.log(&quot;propertyName&quot; in object); // false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;array.shift(); will return (and remove) the first item in the array, as opposed to .pop() which will return and remove the last item in the array. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly .unshift() add an item to the beginning of an array and .push() adds an item to the end of an array. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;indexOf(x) returns the index of the first instance of x in the array whereas lastIndexOf(x) returns the index of the last instance of x in the array. Both take an optional second argument to indicate where to start the search from. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.slice() takes two parameters, start(inclusive), end(exclusive) and returns an array of the items between start and end. If no second parameter is supplied, it takes all the items after the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
console.log([0, 1, 2, 3, 4].slice(2, 4));
console.log([0, 1, 2, 3, 4].slice(2));
&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;array1.concat(array2); will put two arrays into one and return the resulting array. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;   somestring  \n&quot;.trim(); will remove all the whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strings, numbers and booleans are not objects and are &lt;strong&gt;immutable&lt;/strong&gt; which means you cannot add properties to them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever a function is called, a special variable names &apos;arguments&apos; is added to the environment in which the function body runs. arguments has a .length property. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math.random();&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*10));
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All global variables are stored in the global object, that is window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var myVar = 10;
console.log(&quot;myVar&quot; in window);
console.log(window.myVar);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recursion - Generally, recursion can be up to 10 times slower than looping. However, recursion can be more elegant, as such, the programmer must determine whether efficiency or simplicity is more appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

function power(base, exponent) {
    if (exponent == undefined) {
        exponent = 2;
    }

    var result = 1;

    for (var count = 0; count &lt; exponent; count++) {
        result *= base;
    }
    
    return result;
}

function powerR(base, exponent) {
    if (exponent == 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return base * power(base, exponent - 1);
}

console.log(&quot;Recursive: &quot;, powerR(2, 3));
console.log(&quot;Loop: &quot;, power(2,3));
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Closures - The ability to reference an instance of a local variable in an enclosing function.
&lt;pre&gt;
function multiplier(factor) {
    return function(number) {
            console.log(&quot;Factor: &quot;, factor, &quot; Number: &quot;, number);
            return number * factor;
        };
    }
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var twice = multiplier(3);
console.log(twice(5));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Lexical scope is the variable &apos;visibility&apos; of variables within a program via combinations of scope. Essentially, local scopes have access to those scope around them. They do not have access to scopes inside of them.  
* Function declarations can be placed anywhere within the program as they are effectively hoisted to the top of the scope when running. 
&lt;pre&gt;
    foo(&apos;bar&apos;);
    // function declaration
    function foo(string) {
        console.log(&apos;Foo&apos;, string);
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expression functions need to be declared before they are used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
// function definition
var foo = function(string) {
    return &apos;Foo&apos; + string;
}
console.log(foo(&apos;bar&apos;));
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In JavaScript you can have optional arguments/parameters. If there are too many, the extras get ignored. If there are too few, the missing params get undefined. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are basically two ways functions are introduced:
Replication - You find there is code repeated in your program and you write a function to remove this repetition.
Purpose - You have something you need to do, so you write a function to do it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&apos;How difficult it is to find a good name for a function is a good indication of how clear a concept it is that you’re trying to wrap.&apos; - Marijn Haverbeke&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are generally three types of functions:
Pure functions - return values and receive values, they do not access global variables or have side effects. They do not rely on side-effects from elsewhere.
Side effect functions - do not return a value and typically adjust globals. These can be difficult to reason about.
Combination functions - these are functions that combine both the approaches&lt;/li&gt;

I have been building websites for many years, but when I think on my knowledge, I feel as though I am a very reactionary developer. That is to say, I do what needs to be done for the job at hand and move onto the next without too much reflection on what I have just done. This means I am productive and I do a good job, but I feel there is a deeper understanding of the language and how best to use it that is missing. In order to do so, I have decided on the following approach to better understand and code JavaScript. (Keeping in mind that I am writing code as my day job too): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read JavaScript programming books to better understand the language from the ground up. I will be reading: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke  (January). &lt;br/&gt;
JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford (February) &lt;br/&gt;
JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani (March) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on my reading, I will write Feynman Method-like summaries of what I read and publish them to this site. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code the challenges and examples from the above books and publish them on this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend at least 15-30 minutes a day reading and learning from the Mozilla JavaScript documentation. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch JavaScript coding videos and write the code in them along with some summaries. I will be doing the following courses: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Ultimate Angular (January) | &lt;a href=&quot;https://ultimateangular.com/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
Team Treehouse&apos;s Fullstack JavaScript track | [Link] (&lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/full-stack-javascript&quot;&gt;https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/full-stack-javascript&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br/&gt;
Tyler McGinnis&apos; React Courses (March) | &lt;a href=&quot;https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the knowledge and best practice learned (hopefully) from the above and ACTUALLY apply it. It is one thing to know something, it is quite another to do! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people know they should eat healthier, exercise more, eat donuts less and so on. The reality is that we often do not &lt;strong&gt;live&lt;/strong&gt; the way we &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; we should. In my case it is similar when it comes to coding. Sometimes the knowing goes out the window and I end up writing code that works, but might not be the best code I could write. Much like in life, most people cannot go from the couch to running a marathon in one day. Instead you need to build new habits, day by day, reshape and remove old ones and put one foot in front of the other until you get to the level you aspire to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Updates&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;02/01/2018&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read Chapter 4 of Eloquent JavaScript - my notes can be found here &lt;a href=&quot;/til0024&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not review the MDN docs, however, I did spend quite a bit of time learning some Express basics. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not do a Feynman-like method review of the chapter, I will work on this | &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Essentially the goal is to: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the title of the topic on the top of the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarise the concept in plain language using analogies where effective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review what you don&apos;t understand to fill in the gaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplify - pretend you are teaching it to someone else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched around an hours of code, but watched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics-2&quot;&gt;Treehouse Express Basics&lt;/a&gt; videos instead since it is very relevant to my current tasks at work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;03/01/2018&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did not review MDN documents again... I think I need to do this for the first 15-30 minutes in the morning when I get in. Hopefully it will set the tone for the day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Feynman-like reviews either, I think I may need to remove this from the list as I am finding myself short of time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have not yet read Eloquent JavaScript today, pressure to learn Node.js, Express and other things means I am spending my time research these topics and continuing with the video courses. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Completed the videos for Ultimate Angular Typscript Fundamentals and AngularJS Performance | &lt;a href=&quot;https://ultimateangular.com/courses/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ng-repeats through large data collections can be batched in order to increase performance. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UltimateAngular/angular-1-performance-src/blob/master/08-ng-repeat-batching/js/components/todos.component.js#L42&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &apos;track by&apos; on ng-repeat is more performant as AngularJS does not need to attach its own keys at run-time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ng-if is more perfomant than ng-show/ng-hide as AngularJS does not need to set watchers on each instance. It destroys them when no longer required. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use ng-model-options with debounce on input fields as it will reduce the number of digest cycles required. This also delays the evaluation so that you do not need to instantly display validation and can wait a little while. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using AngularJS expressions, you can limit the evaluations required by AngularJS storing an evaluation in a value so that AngularJS does not need to evaluate the terms or function on each digest cycle. If the evaluation is only needed once, the bind-once syntax of :: can be used. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http calls can be batched if within +- 10 milliseconds of each by using &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
angular
.module(&apos;app&apos;, [])
.config(function ($httpProvider) {
	$httpProvider.useApplyAsync(true);
});
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strict Dependency Injection (Strict DI) can be used for minification for performance as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
controller: [&apos;CounterService&apos;, function (CounterService) {
this.$onInit = function () {
  this.count = CounterService.getInitialCount();
};
this.increment = function () {
  this.count = CounterService.incrementCount(this.count);
};
this.decrement = function () {
  this.count = CounterService.decrementCount(this.count);
};
}]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On production builds, there is no need for all the AngularJS specific .data that gets added at runtime. This can be turned off by doing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
angular
.module(&apos;app&apos;, [])
.config(function($compileProvider) {
	$compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false);
})
;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The $onDestroy lifecycle hook can be used on AngularJS ^1.5 to do garbage collection and remove data bindings, especially when using things like EventHandlers. This can save significantly on memory usage during the lifespan of the Single Page Application. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you are working behind a corporate proxy, first setup Git for this: git config --global http.proxy &lt;a href=&quot;http://username:password@proxy:port&quot;&gt;http://username:password@proxy:port&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check it looks right: git config --global --get http.proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also unset it: git config --global --unset http.proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Azure portal, select your App Service, then select Deployment Options and configure your local Git as a deployment source. Take note of your deployment credentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git checkout your-branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add your azure instance as a remote via: git remote add azure &lt;a href=&quot;https://your.provided.azure.git&quot;&gt;https://your.provided.azure.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check that the remote added by running: git remote -v&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the AngularJS app runs from the dist folder,  you will need to: touch .deployment | code .deployment &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[config]
folder = dist
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will also need to remove the dist/ line from your .gitignore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git add --all &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git commit -m &quot;.deployment for deploying from repo to Azure. Update .gitignore for this purpose. Adding /dist&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git push azure your-branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that Azure deploys from the master branch by default, to change this, you can add an Azure App Setting on your App Service called deployment_branch with the name of your-branch. Remember to stop and start your App Service once this has been done. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once your push has been successful, check your App Service URL. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next steps: Use Deployment Slots to manage moving your Development service through Staging/UAT to Production.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Use | as an alternation in regex patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The past few days I have been working through some tutorials, one on React and the other on AngularJs 1.6. While I am making progress, I am not sure what to make of the incredible amount of config and boilerplate one has to setup in order to get going. I understand that modern JS apps have a lot on their plate and one needs to cater to all these different development processes and build processes, but with it seems to me that the same convenience that makes NPM so powerful is the same thing that makes it so tricky to figure out what is happening when something goes wrong. While I have managed to get the projects running, on one occassion there is a NPM registry completely missing. On the other, I have forked a repo directly and run npm install and out of the box, babel/register cannot load... &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This tutorial seems to be somewhat outdated. It does however, take you through the proces of configuring your environment manually (more or less) which, I think, will be valuable longer term. Note that you may run into issues with npm start when configuring the CSS Modules and loaders. The best thing to do here is to take a look at the packages.json file in the GitHub repo and compare the version numbers. When I installed the dependencies, I received the latest in everything and this broken some of the code. Setting the dependencies to the versions on GitHub should rectify this. ([Credit] (&lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1j51enm&quot;&gt;http://disq.us/p/1j51enm&lt;/a&gt;))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also need to change the way the Component Class is setup according to ES2016 as JS classes namely &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
class App extends React.Component{
render() {
return (&lt;div className={styles[&apos;container&apos;]}&gt;Hello world!&lt;/div&gt;)
}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledge that you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; find a way to solve the problem. It might not be right now, today or even tomorrow, but at some point in the future you will solve it. As such, each attempt is an experiment. Succeed or fail, at each turn, reconsider what you think you know or what you think is happening. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear some space in your day to think about what you need to do, write down the result you are looking for and how you might go about it. If you have a few options, great! Write them down too. Work backwards and forwards to try and break the problem down into smaller steps. Arrange them, re-arrange them. Basically, break the problem down into pieces and attack those one by one. Programming is far easier in incremental steps. Small results stacked on top of each other go a very long way. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider that part or all of the reason you cannot solve this problem is because you are assuming something is happening that isn&apos;t. Maybe you aren&apos;t actually doing what you think you are doing. Or vice-versa, maybe you are doing the wrong thing. Re-trace your steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change is progress: If you are getting an error and then you get a different error this is good! Think about what you did, rewind the change and play it back. What is happening? Why did it happen? What does this tell you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change is good in another way too: change of context. Take a break, get a cup of coffee, go for a walk, do something else for a while. It often helps to put the problem at the back of your mind for a little while. If you get to the end of the day with no success. Sleep on it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google. Google is your fiend. Google your problem, see what you find. &lt;em&gt;Read&lt;/em&gt; the source documentation. Try the example code. Look for similar examples. Read through Stack Overflow answers. Get ideas. Try different things. Most importantly, read the code. Maybe you are missing something? Chances are good someone has encountered the same or at least a similar problem to yours. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are getting really stuck, try and separate the problem out into a simplified version of things. If you can get a basic example right, maybe you can build something up to contribute towards a more complex one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rubberduckdebugging.com/&quot;&gt;Rubber-duck debugging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are still stuck, search for a video course that is similar or matching your problem. You will be amazed at the courses and content you can find online. Sometimes, spending a few hours and few rands/dollars/euros on solidifying your knowledge and skills can go a very long way. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have tried all of the above, and I mean really tried, then enlist some help. Before you do though, take a break, retrace your steps one by one and repeat the Rubber Duck strategy before you do. It&apos;s always worth one more shot. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get a grey area on first load of your Ng-Map, try this | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps#grey-area-in-google-maps&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
//vm.map is the Ng-Map instance
var center = vm.map.getCenter();
google.maps.event.trigger(vm.map, &quot;resize&quot;);
vm.map.setCenter(center);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to do a fairly large merge with many conflicts today. My suggestion is to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git checkout branch-to-be-merged-into
git checkout -b pre-merge-branchname
git merge longlast-merged-branch
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have resolved all the conflicts, create a pull request from the pre-merge-branchname to the branch-to-be-merged-into. Then merge from there. This will, in theory, prevent you from screwing up your main branches by utilizing the pre-merge-branchname as a kind of &lt;em&gt;staging&lt;/em&gt; area for your merge. However, it is best you do not let your branches get too far out of sync if possible. This will reduce the number of conflicts and be easier to manage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On that note, VS Code is useful in that it highlights merge conflicts in the &quot;map&quot; on the right along with the purple highlights and C indicators. The trick is that, these colours/codes do not change once you have resolved, so you need to be sure to keep track and do your resolutions in a very methodical manner. I would however like to discover a better way to manage these conflicts? I am thinking something along the lines of a &lt;em&gt;Beyond Compare-like&lt;/em&gt; side-by-side view with easy to use -&gt; and &amp;#x3C;- buttons for &apos;Approve current&apos; or &apos;Approve incoming&apos; or to make a merge/manual edit of the conflicting lines. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be investigating this possibility next week: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jfromaniello/9207698&quot;&gt;Integrate Beyond Compare with Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scootersoftware.com/support.php?zz=kb_vcs#gitlinux&quot;&gt;Beyond Compare and Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Perez writing for &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/apples-widened-ban-on-templated-apps-is-wiping-small-businesses-from-the-app-store/?utm_source=raywenderlich.com+Weekly&amp;#x26;utm_campaign=58cb5c275d-raywenderlich_com_Weekly_Issue_145&amp;#x26;utm_medium=email&amp;#x26;utm_term=0_83b6edc87f-58cb5c275d-415822029&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many companies have recently been given a January 1, 2018 deadline, after which point any new apps they submit will be rejected by the App Store Review team, they’ve been told by Apple. In the meantime, some have been able to maintain their existing apps, but it’s unclear how long that will last. [...] What’s unfortunate about the expanded policy enforcement is that these app makers specifically target the small business market. They build apps for businesses that don’t have the internal resources to build their own apps or can’t afford to hire a custom shop to design a new iOS app from scratch.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning up the App Store is a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple clamping down on spammy, keyword-squatting, low quality apps is a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banning apps only because they are generated by a template or app builder is not a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the argument that this move by Apple is akin to banning websites running WordPress or Squarespace from the internet is off base. The App Store is not the internet. The App Store is Apple&apos;s. Right of admission reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case can also be made in defence of Apple&apos;s move that, if these app generators allow legitimate small businesses to generate apps, the same will go for spammy businesses generating spammy apps. Chances are fair that there is a side to this story not highlighted in the article and that Apple may well be responding to scenarios where these generators are being used to submit many low-quality apps to the App Store. If this is the case, the situation would improve if the companies behind the generators were to apply a more rigorous approach to enforcing standards on their customers. In the same breath however, this would likely reduce the app generator sales pitch - which is anyone can make an app, easily, quickly and cost effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does not ring true about this situation is that Apple&apos;s focus seems to be on the &lt;em&gt;implementation details&lt;/em&gt;. On the surface it seems that Apple may be using this as a polite way of kicking out hordes of low quality apps without saying so directly. Ultimately though, the centre of the affair should be that the banning of apps from the App Store should be about app &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; and app &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;. That is to say, that the app should have a purpose and reason to exist beyond just being a copycat or spam. While it may irk Apple to have, for example, 50 pizza ordering apps that are more or less the same, chances are good that there are, at the same time, some unique, high quality apps that are built by generators too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t know anything about the technical merits of these bans, but as mentioned in the article, Apple&apos;s partnership with IBM and their app generators are not included in the ban. The optics of this are poor: &quot;Large successful company can sell template apps to large corporate customers for very high fees, but John Doe down the way may not use the same approach in a more cost effective manner&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case, one needs to consider the sheer scale of the App Store. The volumes of app submissions are enormous and as the saying goes &quot;You can&apos;t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs&quot;. However, if you take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shoutem.com/&quot;&gt;Shoutem&lt;/a&gt; website, it certainly &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like they have created a high quality product and now, their egg is broken. Apple does not mind breaking a few eggs on balance, yet the rub is that there are real people on the other end of these businesses catering to real needs and real gaps in the market. Apple is eager to promote the successful underdog stories however it is not all roses in the App Store. This reminds developers that this is not the Internet. This is a walled garden and you are at the whim of a gatekeeper whether you like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without being able to see more clearly how Apple judges or determines these bans it is difficult to side with Apple on the surface of it. As is often the case, more transparency and clear guidelines would alleviate the confusion. This is precisely what Congressman Ted W Lieu asks for in his letter to Apple. The concern is that Apple is &quot;casting too wide a net&quot; and it seems this could be true. If anything, large tech companies likely do not want to be under any further scrutiny than is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, quality should come before implementation. Just because your app was generated in some way, does not necessarily mean it is low quality. In the end, while we all know the App Store is not a level playing field, developers would rest easier at night knowing that if John Doe down the way cannot build apps from templates, then IBM should not be allowed to either.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Web.Config exception, Ng-Map miscellaneous and Hotel.]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you want to exclude a specific folder from a blanket redirect rule in Web.Config and this to your  < condition > When using the AngularJS…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0010/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0010/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to exclude a specific folder from a blanket redirect rule in Web.Config and this to your &amp;#x3C;condition&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;add input=&quot;{URL}&quot; pattern=&quot;/path/folder/.*$&quot; negate=&quot;true&quot; ignoreCase=&quot;true&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using the AngularJS plugin Ng-Map, you can lazy load Google Maps - Make sure not include the regular Google Maps script in your HTML | &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngmap.github.io/#/!map-lazy-load-params.html&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to initialise the map in Ng-Map based on an action you can do this | &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngmap.github.io/#/!map-lazy-inint.html&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hotel is a nifty utility that lets you launch your local servers from one place npm install -g hotel &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; hotel start | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/typicode/hotel&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then run: hotel add &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt; (or whatever your server is)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great article by Erik Dietrich on the expert beginner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert beginner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;An expert beginner is a small king in a small kingdom [...] Management gives him the run of the place in spite of the fact that, as it turns out, he’s not really very good at what he does.&quot; - Erik Dietrich&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring a bell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it did, let&apos;s try tease this out a little more since it touches on some of wider themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kruger Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.&quot; - Wikipedia&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4627373&quot;&gt;10 Years Experience VS 10 x 1 Year Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Ask yourself: Have you got 10 years of experience or do you have 10 x 1 year&apos;s experience?&quot; - Don&apos;t know who&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impostor syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Those suffering from impostor syndrome believe their achievements the result of luck or favor rather than merit.&quot; - Erik Dietrich&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Erik delineates in his piece, the expert beginner and the impostor-syndrome-afflicted are two sides of the same coin. Each side reflecting the positive aspect and negative aspect of the issue. Essentially, we dislike expert beginners and we like the impostors. As Erik points out, the difference stems from feedback blindness and the inability to internalize feedback. I would add to this that, the difference also stems from the mixture of the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal validation or external praise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifelong learning or fixed mindset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How it looks or how it works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will tend to find that the expert beginner is motivated by an alignment on the negative side of the items above. They are looking for external praise to validate their internal insecurities. They have a fixed mindset because they have found their comfort zone in an area in which they know enough to be dangerous and they do not want to venture beyond that border for fear of being found out. In that sense, you can see they are cut from the impostor cloth, but they do not want to admit it and actively argue against it. Lastly, because the expert beginner knows enough to be dangerous, they can produce something that looks like it works. Yet when you scratch beneath the surface you start to realise that the room is only clean because all the junk has been hidden under the bed (Unfortunately, the dirty socks are sticking out from under it). The irony is that, as illustrated by the Dunning-Kruger effect, the expert beginner does not have the ability to recognise their incompetence. (If they do, they will not admit it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expert beginner shies away from the positive side of the 3 items because the external validation is a replacement for the lack of the internal. The fixed mindset is more concerned with consolidating power and influence as opposed to improving upon (or even realising their own shortcomings). When you have a hammer, everything is a nail. Since they fear being caught out of their comfort zone for all to see, they essentially relive the same year of experience many times over. Lastly, the expert beginner is primarily concerned with the outward appearance because in fact they know the internal mechanisms are just cobbled together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason, I think, that people dislike the expert beginner is that we can see past the facade. We know the plaster is cracking and that the bricks are not aligned as they should be, yet the expert beginner illustriously keeps painting over the cracks hoping that enough layers of plaster and paint will keep the house from falling. This gets to why I think we like the impostors. Impostors tend to be somewhat realistic (more or less) about their limitations and tend to be actively looking to improve on their shortcomings. Any time an impostor speaks about feeling like an impostor, people relate because it speaks to that impostor in all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I think the difference between the two is that the impostor is willing to venture out into their discomfort. They are willing to make mistakes and own them. To lay the bricks again. Not just continue painting over the cracks everyone can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. I use the word impostor in the sense that if you are in some way honest about your abilities, you will realise there are factors beyond your pure skill that lead you to where you are. It takes a village and all that. I do not mean impostor in the myopic I&apos;m not good enough sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, as Seth Godin says, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/10/imposter-syndrome.html&quot;&gt;we are all impostors&lt;/a&gt;, so get out and dance with your fear!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[CSS left:auto, strikethroughs on OneNote and Bootstrap Modal trickery.]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you need to overwrite an absolutely positioned element to the other side of the container If you use Microsoft OneNote you can…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0009/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0009/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to overwrite an absolutely positioned element to the other side of the container&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;.rtl {
.className {
    right:0; 
    left: auto; /* this will overwrite the original left: 0; */
}
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use Microsoft OneNote you can strikethrough text by selecting it and pressing: CTRL + -&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a Bootstrap 3 modal, you can create a space of clickable content above the modal backdrop by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;/* Say we want to push it down 50px */
.modal-backdrop, .modal {
top:50px;
}
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/* If you then wanted to stretch the modal to cover the whole screen */
.modal-dialog, .modal-content{
height:100%;
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.modal-dialog {
width: 100%;
}       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another useful Bootstrap modal trick - if you want to make sure the user clicks on a modal button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$(&apos;#myModal&apos;).show({
backdrop: &apos;static&apos;,
keyboard: false
});&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

First published on 2017/12/12. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/VenyaGeskin1/status/897741302573535232&quot;&gt;rumour mill&lt;/a&gt; around the Apple TV Set has started churning again. Let&apos;s examine this topic for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hockey Puck&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of the &quot;TV&quot; is in the streaming of content to a hockey puck device. Whether that puck is &quot;integrated&quot; into the panel remains to be seen. The latest Apple TV is already coming under criticism for what is seen to be an overly inflated price for something that is done as well in considerably cheaper devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, Apple charges premium prices for its integration of hardware, software and services. While Apple TV is a good product, it is not widely considered good enough for the price tag in an area where the software is not considered a differentiating factor (yet). TVs and hockey pucks have, until recently, struggled when it came to software, and I would venture to say that most people dislike the software bundled with regular TVs and satellite/cable boxes. The challenge here is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people just make do with the crappy (but improving) TV interfaces they have.
There are not that many &quot;killer&quot; apps. Broadly there are only two at present: video and games. With a bit of music thrown in (however, that job is being eaten by smart speakers and soon the HomePod).
As such, delivering an easy to access streaming app, game or music player is just about all the average home viewer wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differentiating factor, is the service (or the game). HBO, Netflix, Hulu or Amazon are not limited to one box, they are on all the boxes. Ditto, more or less, when it comes to streaming music. As such, the choice of box is more often than not driven by price and &quot;good enough&quot; with the true decision point being &quot;Which streaming services do I sign up for?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4K is a feature not a selling a point and will be adopted across all devices and services in time. The integration of software and the value of &quot;how it works&quot; is not that valuable in the living room at present. Especially if you are not deeply invested into the iTunes ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the mobile phone and computer, the integration of software and hardware is so critical because the use cases for the devices are so diverse. They enable so many people to do so many things that are used in so many situations. When it comes to TV, most people just want to watch TV (or YouTube), play games or listen to music (when not watching the screen). For the rest they have their phone, tablet and increasingly some form of voice computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Apple already has a a horse in the hockey puck race, that leaves Apple with the screen. Apple makes some gorgeous displays. And as Nilay Patel convincingly lays out in his piece about the possibilities of ProMotion for a TV set. Apple can surely bring some much needed improvements to the experience. However, that argument to one side, despite the fact that Apple makes gorgeous displays and has some great software to make them even better, for some time it looked highly likely that Apple would be leaving the external monitor market. Only selling integrated devices - which a TV set would be. That was until the announcement of the Mac Pro and the poor showing of other brand monitors. As such, if there is any credence to this rumour, it is that Apple will be looking to re-enter the monitor market with a range of high-end monitors that are there to be the perfect display for your Mac Pro or possibly your Apple TV. An expensive and premium monitor for a niche market of customers willing to shell out a lot of money for Apple hardware. I suppose that the market for such high-end, specialised devices is small. The equation in many people&apos;s minds might be that they want to strike a balance with good picture quality and price when it comes to the screen and video quality. For most people, I suspect, they may be willing to shell out a little more on the screen, but then what is left for the puck when they have to pay for all their video service and satellite/cable too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Too Many Products&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not go so far as to say Apple has too many balls in the air at the moment. It is just that some balls stay in the air longer. That is to say, some products do not progress and improve as quickly as others or as quickly as some customers would like. The addition of a raised, white ring on the Apple TV remote screams &quot;we just didn&apos;t have time/it&apos;s not a priority at present&quot;. There are few devices in Apple&apos;s current stable that raise so much ire as the Apple TV Remote, yet with Apple&apos;s skill sets would be achievable without massive investments. However, the need to field an edge to edge phone, bring the cellular Apple Watch, AirPods and a completely revamped Mac line to bear as well as a new product, the HomePod, is clearly taking priority over the TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gut tells me the HomePod will follow the same path as the Apple TV. Amazon will keep iterating and expanding for all it is worth in the Home/TV area since it does not play in the mobile space at present. Google&apos;s contributions will be more similar to Apple&apos;s in that they will come out with a new device and vision every now and then but will not submit the necessary resources to making them must have devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all well and good to say that Apple should enter a space and save those of us frustrated by less than perfect experiences, but the reality is that product categories are not one time things. When Apple enters a market they believe they can make a difference there, but they cannot enter every market and regularly, update all those products all the time. One need only look to the frustrations around the Mac, iPad and Apple TV upgrade cycles to realize there is no magic bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple will slowly but surely keep turning the wheel in the TV space and a hockey puck keeps their options open while they tease out the threads and see where they lead. A successful HomePod may well start to tip the scales towards Apple creating a larger presence in the living room over time. The fact is, coming out with a premium TV set, with ProMotion and perfectly mastered video will convince some, but the reality is that good enough is a strong motivator in the TV market at present. For Apple it will be a case of finding the right levers to pull in the right way to make the entry worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for now, I think Apple will keep chipping away at the TV. At times the change is imperceptible and frustrating but it is happening. Just not as fast as some would hope.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thoughts on Apple Acquiring Shazam.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/11/apple-shazam-deal/&quot;&gt;Apple Confirms Shazam Acquisition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&apos;t realize Shazam have been around since 1999!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did Google ever kick the tires on a deal? If you take a look at YouTube comments on videos that have music, inevitably there are people asking &quot;What song is that?&quot; Or &quot;Who is the artist?&quot; Having to use another app to figure out the song and then yet another app to actually get hold of the music is too much friction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Apple says in their statement on the acquisition. This is a natural fit to Apple Music. To my mind it will widen the funnel into Apple Music and remove layers of friction in the process of recognize &gt; discover &gt; purchase. Integrating this into the OS/Siri layer so that it is easily and more importantly, instantly available when you need it os a good step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The potential of the integration of Shazam into Apple TV is appealing! How many times have you heard a song in a movie or TV show and you wonder what it is? I can&apos;t count how many times I hear something good on TV but then having to bring up the phone, open the app and record. Often this process takes too long and the moment passes. Built into the OS, into Siri, connected to the streaming is where this should be. It is the natural form and extension to the question of &quot;Who is this?&quot; when hearing a great song.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens to the existing integrations to Spotify and Snapchat?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I imagine the Android version will remain since Apple Music is on Android.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;console.log in a Node.js/React.js context may mean the terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ctrl + C to quit the task: gatsby develop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts on today&apos;s learning:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you miss crucial words in tutorials which have a big impact on progress. In the above tutorial, whenever you update gatsyb-node.js you need to stop and start the gatsby server. Added to that, console.log in the exports.onCreateNode function will log to the terminal, not the browser console. This had me thinking my code was not working for quite some time as I was looking to the browser console for the logged data. Regardless, the lesson is persevere! Re-trace your steps, with a fine-tooth comb if necessary, there is something you are assuming that is happening that isn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Forget perfect!

During my investigation, I found a dead link on the W3C page explaining the topic. As I scrolled to the bottom of the page, I noticed a &quot;Leave a Comment&quot; link. On a whim, I figured, &quot;Why not?&quot;. As a developer, I appreciate it when someone gives me a heads-up on a dead link so that I can fix it. I don&apos;t know why, but I half-expected a mailto link to open up and that I would send an email out like a message in a bottle, never to hear back. I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted with a GitHub page prompting me to log in. (This is a reflection of my outdated ideas than on W3C processes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective. My GitHub account tells me that I joined on 23 May, 2011. Up until last week it was a skeleton in my closet. I created it, and then never used it again. Even now, it is in the ICU. There are several reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company I work for does not share its work on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have until very recently, only used Subversion for version control, and that was behind a corporate proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had no experience using Git. (Yes, in 2017, sad, but true)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To date, I have not taken part in open source development nor do I have a side-project to share publicly. (Also sad, but true)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the above are just excuses &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never the less, I logged in with my dormant GitHub account and created an Issue. I can&apos;t recall ever having done this before. Usually, at this point, I don&apos;t proceed since I tend to think &quot;They are probably already aware of it&quot;. Out of curiosity, I went ahead and logged the issue and thought nothing of it. Several minutes later, I got a response saying that a server at MIT (of all places) was down and that the problem would be recitifed shortly. This blew my mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, in my experience, people do not respond. They are busy, they are important, maybe they already know, maybe they don&apos;t care, maybe all of the above or none of the above. Secondly, I have a clear-cut case of impostor syndrome. My code smells. No-one is going to look at my work and marvel. Most of the time, I am trying to make deadlines as best I can with what I can. On the upside, I know I can do better. Every day, I get to work and I try do a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the early days when I first read about the W3C, web standards, CSS layouts and the people who were leading the so-called Web2.0 movement. These were visible people, connected in a group that through whatever avenue had established themselves in a meaningful way. They were pioneers, leaders in the field and clearly, way smarter than I would ever be. In my own way, as a coder not knowing his absolute from his relative positioning, I looked up to these people. I saw something I wanted to learn. Much in the way a kid might look up to someone they admire. You think, maybe one day I will be like them...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that you won&apos;t be like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not if you don&apos;t ship. Not if you don&apos;t get better at the hard stuff. Not if you don&apos;t put your work out there for everyone to see. And even if you do, it might not happen. Deal with it. Keep coding, keep learning and keep shipping. We aren&apos;t all on that level. Not everyone is pro. Most people aren&apos;t even second-division or even third. To make matters worse, on top of the impostor, sits a thinker. I think way too much. Over think, under do has been my motto for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what this hideous looking website is about. It is about putting work out there. As it is.&lt;/p&gt;

First published on 2017/12/07. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Amazon Prime Video app on Apple TV yesterday is a reminder of the scale of challenge I believe HBO will face when Game of Thrones, currently the biggest (and last) TV show on earth, ends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix is currently available in over 190 countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Prime Video is available in over 200 countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HBO Go is available in 1 country. HBO Now is available in that same country as well as US territories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HBO itself, is available in over 50 countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of the world gets its HBO shows through regular TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added to the pure reach of these services, one of the more underrated aspects of Netflix&apos;s strategy is that they are investing heavily into foreign language shows. In the past few months myself or my girlfriend have watched:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peaky Blinders (UK)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fauda (Israel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cable Girls (Spain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark (Germany)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luther (UK)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sherlock (UK)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of the above is that, over the past few years, the majority of shows we have watched have been American shows. Now that we have access to such variety, there is no reason for us to watch only American shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one disputes HBO&apos;s ability to create incredible shows that people the world over want to watch, but the questions I have are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can HBO extricate itself from all the international rights deals that feed its business model in order to go direct to customers worldwide?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can HBO build out the necessary networks in order to to reach those worldwide customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can HBO continue to create the great shows while Netflix, Amazon, Apple and others start to compete for and possibly to crowd out the talent base with their deep pockets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, that Netflix is very quickly becoming the default. Amazon seems to be rapidly establishing itself as the sidekick in second place (especially since it is free for Prime members). Personally, the third spot is currently reserved to the local competitor Showmax (which has the rights to all HBO&apos;s shows in this country and is quickly expanding in Africa) and fourth place is a holdout for what is likely to be Disney&apos;s horse in the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if HBO&apos;s answer to my 3 questions above is: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining question is can HBO do all of that before people lose their desire the fork out for yet another video service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of this goes without saying that YouTube, Facebook and Instagram are also steadily carving out more viewing time from all of the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** There is however, always that anticipated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/hbo-clarifies-game-of-thrones-prequel-spin-off-plans-w485701&quot;&gt;Game of Thrones spin-off&lt;/a&gt; to potentially kickstart things.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Curl through proxy, variables in Postman, multiple terminals in VS Code, Insomnia App.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Create variable in Postman: postman.setGlobalVariable("variable", "value"); Discovered the Insomnia App |  Link Create multiple terminals in…]]></description><link>https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0004/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nicholaspretorius.github.io/til0004/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been an avid blog reader for many years. I first became aware of the form way back when Blogger was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)#History&quot;&gt;thing&lt;/a&gt;. I don&apos;t remember which blogs I read and the habit soon died away. Many years later, more or less nearing the end of 2010 I started reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and kept up to date with RSS feeds via Google Reader (&lt;a href=&quot;http://googlereader.blogspot.co.za/2013/07/a-final-farewell.html&quot;&gt;RIP&lt;/a&gt;). I have been coming back ever since. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after becoming a regular Daring Fireball reader, I became aware of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/&quot;&gt;The Talk Show&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (during the James Bond days) and by extension the &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/&quot;&gt;5by5&lt;/a&gt; network of podcasts (which is where The Talk Show began). Via 5by5 I discovered &quot;Build &amp;#x26; Analyze&quot; which was the first time I had listened to a developer talking about his craft other than talking to my coworkers. It was refreshing and insightful to listen and learn from some really smart people having conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years later still, it was on Marco Arment and _DavidSmith&apos;s podcast &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/radar&quot;&gt;Under the Radar&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that I came across the term &quot;unexpected complexity&quot;. The first half of which this site is named after. Unexpected complexity describes the challenges developers often encounter when building software and encountering complexity that they had not considered or planned for. I felt the term perfectly captured one of the daily challenges that comes up in writing code and solving problems. More importantly though, in some ways I see unexpected complexity as a lens through which to see some of life&apos;s own challenges. We often think things are going to be one way and discover them to be another. This is neither good nor bad, but it is interesting, that despite the fact that the unexpected and unplanned-for complexity happens almost every day, it still often feels that we do not expect the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus, this site was named. I do not yet know what format, or content I will share on this site, but the important thing for me is to write and to communicate. Consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a start, after many stops and many more false starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had the good fortune to do a fair bit of traveling the past year. Reading AVC recently, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://avc.com/2017/10/locked-and-unlocked-phones/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; seemed to indicate that the lock on the SIM card had something to do with the use of an iPhone (If in this case &apos;provider&apos; means Apple and not T-Mobile). Being an iPhone user myself, this is not a situation I have faced in my travels and I suspect it is the carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience thus far, it is the carrier that does this regardless of the phone in use. Each time I have travelled to another country for longer than a few days, I have opted to buy a local pay-as-you-go SIM card and load it with data. Roaming is overly expensive (prohibitively so in the case of data) and in some cases unreliable. This strategy has worked successfully without any difficulty (apart from not being able to remember my &apos;local&apos; number) in Chile (Claro), Spain (Orange) and Namibia (MTC). Interestingly, all 3 providers put expiry limits on the data - in Chile (if memory serves) and Spain, the expiry on data was one month after purchase. In Namibia (or Nambia if your only information source is Donald Trump) the expiry was set to one week. Expiry dates on data feel like a nickel and dime move on the part of the service provider but somewhat understandable at one month. At one week it just seems like money grabbing considering the poor coverage outside of the main towns in the parts of Namibia we travelled through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, not having cellular service was one of the great benefits of being in Namibia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as you don&apos;t break down on the side of the road that is...&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Apple Should Not Buy Sony.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

First published on 2017/10/02. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frederic Filoux&apos;s threw in his few cents on the &quot;what Apple should spend its cash hoard on&quot; topic with his latest blog post titled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mondaynote.com/why-apple-should-buy-sony-22a9d576c1d9&quot;&gt;Why Apple Should Buy Sony&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. Speculating on what Apple will or will not do is certainly fun and going through the thought exercise of building the cases for and against such a hypothetical deal can be educational in building up and framing an understanding of why a company might do something. But therein lies the rub, Frederic&apos;s post only raises the &quot;pros&quot; and and spends very little time on the what would be the &quot;cons&quot;. Considering that Apple is famous for saying &quot;No&quot;, this is a big gap in an otherwise interesting argument for the buying of Sony. So let me present my view on the &quot;cons&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#1 Acquisition Size&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the post, Frederic notes that Apple&apos;s current cash hoard is at $262 billion. At the end of the article, he lists Sony&apos;s market cap as being at $47 billion (just over 20% of the value of the cash hoard). Now, while one cannot say that because Apple has to-date, not made such large acquisitions that it will not do so in the future. It is certainly worth considering what Apple would be looking to gain from spending upwards of $40 billion more than their largest acquisition to date which was a mere $3 billion for Beats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#2 Camera Sensors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary thrust of the article&apos;s argument is that Apple is reliant on Sony for a critical component in the iPhone, namely the image sensor and that it competes with other manufacturers to secure the production of these components from said suppliers. This makes sense, as securing the supply chain to feed the immense demand for components is critical to creating and supplying iPhones the world over. Added to that, Apple has famously driven relentlessly towards &quot;owning&quot; the critical components to their business. Considering the camera is one of the most important pieces of the iPhone and that the photos people take with them are priceless, it certainly makes sense Apple would want to secure this production. The thing to remember here is that generally, Apple does not buy the suppliers. Apple buys and secures the capacity or production from the supplier. What is more likely to happen is that, similar to the A-Series of chips, Apple will design the sensors and then purchase the production from said suppliers. Apple&apos;s ever increasing lead in chip prowess is not due to the production of the chips, but due to the design, integration and optimisation specific to Apple&apos;s needs coupled with the large scale production that brings about the competitive advantage. From that perspective, camera sensors are no doubt important, but colour me skeptical when it comes to Apple buying the cow when it is happy to pay for the milk. Remember also that Apple is a such a large customer, it is highly likely Apple is also the best customer. It is unlikely that even Samsung could compete with Apple&apos;s buying power in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#3 Culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchasing a company as large as Sony with as long a history comes with the enormous challenge of integrating two cultures that are likely to be very different with years of ingrained behaviour. Not to mention the location of the companies and the staff. Apple is primarily located in California, with small branches in other areas and countries. Sony is headquartered in Japan with locations the world-over. Looking at Apple&apos;s list of acquisitions over time, it is clear that Apple prefers to integrate smaller, growing companies into the fold. Mashing two very large companies together is an entirely different proposition. Not to colour Apple with the same brush, but two relatively similar acquisitions in recent history by big American technology companies did not prove very fruitful in the hardware department, namely Google and Motorola as well as Microsoft and Nokia. Apple and Sony sounds like it would fall into that camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#4 Playstation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fredric lists the Playstation with $20 billion in sales as a reason for purchase. While $20 billion is by no means something to sniff at, look at what Apple would need to pay, acquire and integrate to even access that value. First of all, the Playstation is a gaming console. While iOS is a gaming behemoth, Apple has traditionally not shown much interest in venturing into the hardcore gaming market. With the release of the latest Apple TV, this notion has only been reinforced with little to no change to either the remote or even a hint at first party gaming accessories or controllers. Gaming on the Apple TV, as it is, leaves something to be desired for gamers. However, it would not be a stretch for Apple to release an Apple TV product that took &quot;casual&quot; gaming more seriously and released a game controller. Game developers would likely jump at the opportunity should it arise and I doubt that Apple believes the gaming market is unachievable should it set its mind to entering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further to that, I highly doubt Apple thinks it would need Sony&apos;s VR goggles and TV sets. Apple would much prefer to create their own hardware should they choose to do so, and chances are fair that such a product would be an improvement over what Sony has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#5 Films and Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark horse here is Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music. Apple is serious about music and has signalled clear intentions in the original video content arena. Owning these entities would certainly give Apple a large sword to yield. As Fredric notes, SPE is one of the Hollywood Big Six and Sony Music holds around 20% of the music sales industry. Yet again the question arises &quot;What do they gain by doing so?&quot;. The music and film industries are already suspicious of Apple&apos;s movements here. Purchasing one of the major studios could possibly endanger existing or future content deals Apple has with the other large houses and could send the other houses running into the arms of a competitor. Remember that the labels hold a lot of the power in the music streaming business and while it would be great for Apple to have &quot;exclusive&quot; content, it goes against the desire of the artists and content that would arise. Artists want their work to be consumed by the largest number of people possible - yes Apple Music is on Android, but containing Sony content to be exclusively on the Apple ecosystem is likely to engender as much unhappiness as it is business. Besides, for that amount of money, if Apple wanted to go all in on video content like that, why wouldn&apos;t they buy Netflix or Spotify? Failing that, why not just buy Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music outright without the rest of Sony?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I am sure the totality of Sony&apos;s business may signal possible gains for Apple, but it is the cost of those gains that one needs to consider. To my ears, such an acquisition does not align with what i know about Apple. Purchasing a huge company and trying to force integration in areas of competency that are already within Apple&apos;s wheelhouse seems like a horribly expensive exercise and likely to deliver far less value in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to distill the argument, my retort would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing camera sensors - Apple designs its own sensors and purchases the production capacity as they do with other components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware - Apple can create the necessary hardware and software necessary to build VR/AR goggle TV sets and better gaming hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture - Apple is likely not looking to merge such a large company into itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music - Apple already has a music platform and is iterating on it slowly but surely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Film - Apple is investing and slowly developing in the area.&lt;/li&gt;

First published on 2017/06/06. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple TV is the neglected child in the family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone else think that: Apple TV + casual gamers + Apple game controller + in-app-purchase = taking candy crush from a baby?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lazy people don&apos;t yet have a reason to buy Apple Watch, but the watch continues to be attractive to fit or want-to-be-fit people. (Tim Cook and Craig Federighi are fit people. Did you see them running on and off stage?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kids might also want those Pixar Apple Watch faces. (Adults may even want them)
*&apos;Do Not Disturb While Driving&apos; is thoughtful and might save lives. (If it is the only idea to come out of Project Titan and least its a good one!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did Apple just become a bank with peer-to-peer payments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hopefully &quot;Pro&quot; users will stop complaining. For now. (Audiophiles will start complaining soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPad Pro will probably benefit slightly from massive hardware and software improvements. On the other hand, slight business model improvements in the App Store will probably benefit iPad massively. Go figure. (Where are you trial and upgrade pricing?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Store 2.0. (Phill Schiller walked off stage before announcing trial and upgrade pricing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WWDC 2018 for the end of iTunes? (And the beginning of Apple Music, Apple Video, Apple Podcasts, Apple App Store, Apple Audio + iBooks, Apple Whatever-else-is-in-iTunes.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is QR Code scanning only available in China?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mall and Airport maps seems like a good idea for Apple Maps. (No matter where I am in the world, I will get lost in a mall. Does Google Maps have this?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Thoughts about the ongoing &quot;services narrative&quot;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When do the data storage tiers for iCloud get better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When does iCloud TimeMachine get introduced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not to say these are not hard problems to solve, but surely this is relatively low-hanging fruit as far as services go?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As great as the Wingnut AR demo was... When do we see a demo of the Star Wars chess game (&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/35594/does-the-game-that-chewie-plays-with-r2-d2-have-a-name&quot;&gt;Dejarik&lt;/a&gt;) from the Millenium Falcon?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;English-speaking people continue to hate on Siri. (Except of course if you don&apos;t speak the four or two languages supported by Google or Alexa)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alexa has a bazillion skills. Siri only has a few. But, a bazillion skills in a language you don&apos;t speak don&apos;t help in a country that doesn&apos;t sell the Echo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of bonus points for diversity with the first mother/child-to-be-presenter I have seen at a big technology event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the Monument Valley 2 mention drive more sales than the Monument Valley House of Cards mention?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Siri Hi-Fi, sorry, HomePod will please 0 audiophiles and 0 price conscious buyers. I imagine several other people will be pleased and buy one (or more).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People already calling Siri out for its minor role in the HomePod story. And yes, HomePod will probably be a huge flop. But:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better sound quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 languages/36 country localisations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More countries with Apple Stores. (Yes, actual stores that sell products. With Geniuses and Apple Today)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More announcements and integrations by the end of the year (Here&apos;s looking at you, Apple TV Elephant in the room).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for those Wynn/Echo sales... if you are premium hotel, do you rather want a cheap Echo in your room with dubious privacy records or an expensive, privacy conscious speaker in your room?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe, just maybe HomePod makes it for the holiday quarter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for having only one HomePod... Nano, Mini, Plus. I am sure they are sitting somewhere in Jony&apos;s lab right now...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn&apos;t look too bad now does it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need machine learning to help remember any more of it. Anyone count how many times they said &quot;machine learning&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[One More Time Around.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

&lt;p&gt;As a kid, Soundgarden was the best! Their albums Badmotorfinger, Superunknown and Down on the Upside were amongst my favourite. My first exposure to them was on a taped copy of Superunkown. A tape! I have memories sitting in my parents lounge just listening to the tape over and over again. Play, rewind, play, rewind. Soon after, some of my first CDs were Soundgarden albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite t-shirt at the time was a Soundgarden tee. It was a kind of bastardised, grey-tie-dyed affair with the Badmotorfinger cover on the front and Superunkown on the back. Or was it the other way around? I bought it at a flea market. I must have worn that shirt through pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard of Temple of the Dog when I was younger, I had no idea who was in the band. It was only later, when I really got into Pearl Jam that I discovered Temple of the Dog. It blows my mind to this day to listen to that band. Chris Cornell and Eddie Vedder in one band?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been lucky enough to see some of my grunge-era heroes live. Eddie Vedder, Matt Cameron and even Dave Grohl with Pearl Jam (Dave went on stage to rock the tambourine for a rendition of &apos;Kick out the Jams&apos;). I even got to see Chris&apos;s bandmates from Audioslave when Rage Against the Machine played their reunion gig in Finsbury Park. Sadly, I never got the chance to see Chris live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been some time since I&apos;ve listened to Soundgarden. King Animal was the last time I remember. Spending so much time in Europe these days, the thought even occurred to me I might get the chance to see them soon. Listening to their albums now, I am struck, not just by how good the songs are, or how much I really love that band, but by how eerily the lyrics evoke the news of Chris Cornell&apos;s death. Some of their greatest songs, &quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot;, &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot;, &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot; delve into some dark parts. The lyrics on &quot;Pretty Noose&quot; left me cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIP Chris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Singing one more time around, might do it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/22/15673712/anker-battery-charger-amazon-empire-steven-yang-interview&quot;&gt;Great article&lt;/a&gt; by Nick Statt on The Verge about Anker. A company in China that makes batteries, chargers, cables and much more. I had never heard of them before seeing the link on &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/22/anker&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pity The Verge resorted to the typical &quot;game&quot; analogy in the headline. One fascinating aspect of this story is how central Google, Apple and some other tech giants are to this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anker&apos;s founder is a former Google employee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anker sells products as good, but not as expensive as giants Apple, Samsung etc. (Read: Tech giants under-serving basic customer needs for charging and portable charging solutions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anker&apos;s design and packaging sensibilities seem to be largely Cupertino-inspired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anker is enabled purely through Amazon. On the flipside, Amazon is one of Anker&apos;s greatest weaknesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anker is following a very strong ladder-up strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all their products though, the one that stands out to me is this - pure genius - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anker.com/products/A1501011&quot;&gt;Compact Car Jump Starter and Portable Charger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many festival-goers would love one of these?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the large role the tech giants play in this story reminds me of a similar success story in South Africa. WeFix is a chain of stores that specialise in repairing mobile phones and tablets. Primarily Apple and Samsung. Similar to charging, this is also a market that has proved to be fertile ground for customers under-served by the large tech companies. Locally, if you drop your phone and crack the screen - if you go to your carrier (in my case Vodacom), they will inevitably take weeks to do anything and you will be left without a phone. There are no Apple Stores in South Africa, but the Premium Apple Reseller, iStore, will likely replace your phone, if it is under warranty, if not, they probably won&apos;t help you. WeFix fit perfectly into the gap, fixing your phone quickly and relatively cheaply - to big success. They have expanded quickly countrywide and are busy launching related businesses in an effort to expand into other areas. Again, following a ladder-up strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting though is as &lt;a href=&quot;https://wefix.co.za/&quot;&gt;WeFix&lt;/a&gt; have made a market out of the gap beneath larger suppliers when repairing phones - there is a market below WeFix being served by small, independent shops that repair phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewinding a little. My first experience with WeFix was when they replaced my iPhone screen in one hour for a fair price in hurry. I was extremely impressed and grateful. What I would have done in India with a camera I do not know. (The screen had been completely shattered the day before I flew to India - I had dropped it while being escorte from the Indian Embassy - but that is another story!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next experience with WeFix was one morning I woke up and noticed my iPhone had not charged. After making sure I had the cable in correctly, I left it be. Hours later I came back and found my iPhone stone dead. Once again, I took it to WeFix. An hour or so later, the consultant phoned me and said all was sorted. Having expected there to be something wrong with the phone and being prepared to fork out for some replacement part, I was pleasantly surprised when he told me they had just cleaned the charging port of all the fluff that had accumulated there. They charged me a small fee for the cleaning and that was it. Again, impressed and relieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time my iPhone refused to charge I was wise to the trick and managed to pull all the fluff out the charging port myself. Tried again, no luck. Naturally, I headed straight for WeFix, confident they would sort the issue out in one hour and be done with it. I was wrong. They came back to me and said nothing could be done. I don&apos;t remember the details but the consultant seemed pretty adamant it was a lost cause. Disheartened, I walked around the mall looking for alternatives. I ended up at the iStore looking at the refurbished, Certified Pre-Owned iPhones straight from California. I bought one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get home, unbox the iPhone, plug it in and off I went. Hours later, I come back, nothing. Certified Pre-Owned iPhone dead. No, not the old, broken one. The brand-almost-new one. This can&apos;t be right can it?
I try it again. No dice. Next day I am back at the iStore. They give me some ideas and tips and I head home again. Nothing works. What now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the mall, walking around looking for options. On a suggestion from my girlfriend, I walk into one of these little shops. Not holding out much hope since, to my mind, the chain goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vodacom takes forever, will charge you a lot and doesn&apos;t care because they are coining it anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iStore can&apos;t replace it, won&apos;t/can&apos;t fix it and is only interested in selling you another device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WeFix can&apos;t fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s broke, ain&apos;t no-one gonna fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk up to the guy behind the counter and tell him my sad story. He asks me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can I open up the phone?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sure&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No warranty?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two minutes Turkish&quot; he says (not really - but he did say two minutes) and walks into a little back office. Two minutes later he comes back, says I should come back in 20 minutes to pick up the phone. True to his word, I come back, he shows me he is charging the phone and turns it on. Working, good as new. To this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I returned the I&apos;m-not-sure-it-was-certified-iPhone. Kudos to iStore who took it with little to no questions asked. I traded it in for an Apple TV and a JBL Charge3. Both fantastic purchases by the way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-one is really &lt;em&gt;beating&lt;/em&gt; anyone. The tech giants can&apos;t &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt; at everything they do. Neither can the smaller giants in smaller markets win everything they do. It is exactly because no-one can &lt;em&gt;beat&lt;/em&gt; everyone. That your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness and that everyone can &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt; at something. That is the nature of the market and the business ecosystems around us. One minute a business is serving the under-served, the next minute it is over-serving and undercut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we all be so lucky as to have websites write stories about how we are being beaten at our own game!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Last Great TV Show.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

First published on 2017/05/21. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game of Thrones will soon end. And with it, the last great TV show. What then for HBO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean by last great TV show is that, it will be the last great TV show born for TV and distributed with TV assumptions. Traditional TV is the past, streaming is the present and future. More specifically, direct streaming is the future. By direct streaming I mean that, the customer pays the streaming service provider directly. Basically, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. While HBO may have direct customer relationships in the US, going by HBO&apos;s status in South Africa, they have no such relationships with the majority of international customers. Coming from South Africa, the only way to watch HBO shows is through local or satellite TV. (Local usually only airs old shows)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my home country of South Africa, there are only 2 ways to watch Game of Thrones (to my knowledge):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DStv - the satellite TV provider (kind of like cable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showmax - a streaming service bankrolled by Naspers. (The same company behind DStv - and of Tencent fame).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You either need satellite (similar to cable) or, you have to wait until the very end of the season until the latest Game of Thrones season is available for streaming or the old series show on local television. Other than that, there are the copies that fell off the back of the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice this situation presents to the market is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DStv gives you access to the latest and greatest as soon as it is available internationally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showmax gives you access to the back catalog as well as back catalogs of local content which will likely never be found on HBO, Netflix or Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this is that, while great for Naspers (the company behind both DStv and Showmax), for cord-cutters, there are no options to (legally) watch Game of Thrones as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, this is fine with HBO as they earn their money from the TV gatekeepers worldwide, who fork out a very large amount of money for the privilege. Naspers probably does not care that much about the cord-cutters, since they are aiming to get their existing customers to purchase both DStv and Showmax. The one&apos;s who don&apos;t, will likely go the Showmax route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What options are there then for cord-cutters to go direct with their money to HBO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially, since like Showmax are doing locally, and I am sure other networks worldwide will attempt to do is to lock-up all the quality content that Netflix/Amazon cannot get in order to differentiate themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HBO Now is available in only 9 countries (at time of writing). South Africa is not one of them. The other option is HBO Go, which requires a cable subscription (similar to the DStv/Showmax proposition). Where do streamers outside of those 9 countries go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot go direct to HBO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot watch the latest season (when it airs) on Showmax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not have a DStv subscription (since I am currently living between countries - however, due to a fortunate circumstance, the place we were staying in did have a DStv decoder so we were able to watch Game of Thrones on TV.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Amazon Prime Video is available in South Africa, the most promising option seems to be Amazon Channels. Amazon Channels offers various &quot;channels&quot; for a fee. As such, you pay for your monthly Amazon Prime Video fee as well as the relevant fee for the channel you want to watch. In essence, you pay a subscription + the subscription for the channel. Unfortunately, the channels service is only available in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game of Thrones is likely HBOs most famous, most watched show of all time. It is also one of the most pirated shows in history. Netflix have resoundingly shown that their offering is effectively killing piracy and torrents. So why does HBO, in 2017, not offer a viable direct option to stream shows for the majority of the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One to start to build up direct customer relationships and two, to combat the rampant piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two cents is that HBO&apos;s existing flock of shows reel in money from traditional networks. This means that HBO are in no hurry to go direct. We are seeing peak HBO. It seems however, that they are clinging to a dying business model and they have no Netflix-competitive service in place currently. It seems to me that even though they may want to go direct to customers around the world, they cannot go direct because they are caught up in a broadcasting rights web in many other markets - as illustrated by the scenario above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HBO Now is available in 9 countries. (For comparison, Amazon Prime Video is now &lt;a href=&quot;http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;#x26;p=RssLanding&amp;#x26;cat=news&amp;#x26;id=2229623&quot;&gt;in over 200 countries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.netflix.com/en/node/14164&quot;&gt;Netflix is in 190&lt;/a&gt;). HBO will no doubt increase the number of countries over time, but the reality is that, Game of Thrones ends in (possibly) 2 seasons time. I would sign up to an HBO direct service in the blink of an eye for Game of Thrones alone. To put that in perspective, despite all the content Showmax has, I will not sign up for their service because, while they may have all the seasons of Game of Thrones past, they do not have it when it matters - as it is showing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the allure of Game of Thrones is that each episode brings an entire social thread with it. Not being able to take part in that, and worse, being continually exposed to the potential of spoilers is a terrible option for customers. The irony is that Game of Thrones is likely to be the last great show TV show. By TV I mean, I mean traditional TV. And by great, I mean one that comes along with the trappings of traditional TV schedules. A show, that has no direct route to its viewers. A show that is viewed around the world, primarily through intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the chances that the next &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; is coming from HBO are increasingly slim considering the investments and market access Amazon and Netflix have. Every year, their viewing numbers get bigger, the pockets get deeper and the freedom they provide to content creators increases. This is not say HBO don&apos;t have a chance, they basically created the type of elevated, cinematic quality shows we now stream everyday. And they will continue to do so, the problem is, they are no longer the golden child. I am convinced HBO will continue to produce quality content, but it is unlikely that they will release a show that occupies the minds of such a significant market in the way Game of Thrones does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that HBO are in their prime now. They are a company built on old assumptions and they are taking to0 long to shift their focus. It is likely they still have time, but time is running out. Game of Thrones is their best bet for launching a worldwide direct to customer streaming service without a customer thinking twice. HBO have already given away the back catalog. The upcoming Game of Thrones seasons are what will make signing up a no-brainer. Once that final show airs, HBO loses considerable leverage with potential customers and the choice is not so clear. Especially when Disney enter the fray.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blood In The Water.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

First published on 2017/05/20. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost as if on cue, Lyft and Waymo have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/technology/lyft-waymo-self-driving-cars.html&quot;&gt;announced a partnership&lt;/a&gt; to bring Waymo&apos;s self-driving technology to Lyft customers. This puts Uber into an increasingly precarious situation. Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once automated driving is viable for ride-sharing services - the costs will be greatly reduced. This will mean a huge competitive advantage for the service that gets there first. Lyft was a small time player with some minor partnerships in this area and Uber was already testing its own technology on city streets. In essence, Lyft had no real plays in this area. Now they are partnered with arguably the leader in self-driving technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Complements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the Lyft/Waymo partnership were not revealed, but it is worth considering that the Lyft/Waymo partnership may mean that Uber is no longer the leader in terms of both ride-sharing and self-driving technology in combination. The importance of this cannot be overstated. Lyft offered no self-driving technology and Waymo did not have a clear line to market access. They complement each other&apos;s needs so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gaining ground&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyft has recently raised more money and will be looking to capitalise on Uber&apos;s problems by attacking Uber in the US. This is likely to be in terms of a price war. This is a knock against Uber&apos;s budgeting as they now need to burn money competing for rides while funding their own self-driving technology. Lyft has no such needs as they focus all efforts on gaining market share from Uber. All the while Waymo focuses on the self-driving technology. No doubt, with Eric Holder&apos;s report still pending, and the Uber/Waymo lawsuit only just beginning. All bets are off as to who will ultimately capture a market that until very recently seemed destined to be Uber&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Route to market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo now has route to market, and likely, is greatly incentivised to capitalise on Uber&apos;s failings. Alphabet, Waymo&apos;s parent company, is no doubt looking for &quot;what&apos;s next&quot; in terms of market opportunities and now, have the possibility to get real skin in the ride-sharing game. Waze has already been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/7/14538064/google-waze-carpool-bay-area-waymo-uber-lyft&quot;&gt;piloting ride-sharing initiatives in California&lt;/a&gt;, so this partnership is likely to be a big boost to Alphabet&apos;s ride-sharing ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data, data, data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the primary benefit of this partnership is that both Lyft and Waymo now have capabilities in areas they did not previously have, one has to wonder what benefits this will bring to the data being employed? Google&apos;s knowledge of your calendar, your appointments, your travel plans, not to mention your mapping and traffic data means that Google knows where you want to go before Uber does. This could bring significant competitive advantage to Lyft. In some respects, Google may be able to &quot;prime the pump&quot; and predict who needs rides where and when before Uber does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows what will happen to Uber next? Uber management seem as likely to destroy the company as help it succeed. At a time when they should be focused on the market, the technology and the opportunities before them, they are fighting significant fires. While they are leagues ahead of competitors in market and mind-share, what happens while their attentions are facing inward rather than outward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A battle of many fronts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber will need to fend off inspired, and continual attack on their current core business of ride-sharing.
At the same time, they will need to conduct an increasingly difficult battle to bring self-driving technology to market. If the lawsuit goes against them, they will be fighting that battle with one hand behind their back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Considerable lead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber&apos;s market leadership is probably considerable, and Lyft does not yet operate outside of the US. As such, Uber is only competing with local players in other markets is likely to not be losing too much ground in those areas as Lyft will still need to enter those markets and build up a customer base. This means that Uber is likely to have some breathing room. Added to that, the partnership between Lyft and Waymo is yet to be proven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the main questions for Uber are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can they resolve the Waymo case relatively unscathed and continue moving forward on self-driving?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How quickly can management put their problems behind them and get back to focusing on their business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, there is blood in the water and the sharks can smell it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Frightful Five.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

First published on 2017/05/15. It was written by myself on another site and has been moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farhad Manjoo has an interesting piece at The New York Times considering which of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/10/technology/Ranking-Apple-Amazon-Facebook-Microsoft-Google.html&quot;&gt;top 5 technology companies and their services one might drop&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I voted as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I debated which one would go first between Amazon and Facebook, the fact is, Amazon barely has a presence in my home country. Strange as it might seem, I have not bought much through Amazon over the years (I still shop the traditional way). I am a huge Audible fan and listen to it most days. As a movie buff, I am also regularly browsing IMDB. The fact that I pay for Audible gave me pause here, as it means enough to me that I am willing to pay for it. I do not pay directly for any of Facebook&apos;s offerings. Regardless, Amazon goes first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is next. I do not use Facebook or Messenger much having turned off all their notifications and banished the apps to a folder on the second-screen of my iPhone. Out of sight, out of mind. I use Instagram fairly regularly and enjoy it, however, I would not miss it that much if it were gone. (My girlfriend on the other hand practically lives in it. While I do not use it nearly as much, Instagram has a notable presence in my life.) The other notable app in Facebook&apos;s collection is WhatsApp. I (and most people I know) use it daily. Considering most of the people I know are split fairly evenly between using iPhones and Android phones, Messages is not a true replacement. Where I am from, WhatsApp is the app everyone uses to communicate. My family uses it, my friends use it and colleagues from work use it. Coming back to the tussle with Audible - while I do not pay for WhatsApp, it certainly saves money on SMS fees!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I had Google pegged at 4th. However, one lens from which I need to view this question is to consider the role work plays in my choice. The applications we use at work are dominated by Microsoft. All communications are done through Outlook or Skype. Pretty much everything is some combination of Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Project and Visio. From a development perspective, I would not shed a single tear for Microsoft if it did not play a role in my day to day. I far prefer MacOS for development, but, I earn a living on Microsoft. Despite my preference for Google, Google leaves the building first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, it is worth elaborating on which Google apps I find most useful. Google Maps is the first. Without a doubt my go to app for travelling. Myself and my girlfriend use it endlessly while travelling and in recent time I have started using the Google Trips app when going to new, unknown cities. Google Maps offline features are a fantastic way to save on data fees. I have used Apple Maps on the odd occasion, but none the less it is the odd occasion. When I have used it, it has not proved to be much help. It may very well be improving in many ways, but in my experience it is still lacking. I am however, willing to try. (On the travel note - Google Flights has also proved to be useful entry point to searching for flights and comparing prices in recent time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube is great! I like YouTube and I think it occupies similar territory to what Facebook videos do for most people. I use it to fill small spaces in between other things. It almost goes without saying that I use GMail on a daily basis. The thing is, I am pretty ambivalent about email. It is no doubt essential, however, if I had to jettison the service, so be it. Lastly, Chrome. I use it every day and prefer it to Safari because of one thing. Chrome Developer Tools! As a web developer, I spend pretty much all day in Chrome DevTools. On Windows, Chrome is the best browser. I used to be a great supporter of Firefox, but in recent years, Firefox has proven to be average. While it certainly better than IE and Firefox is improving. Chrome is still my bread and butter. (That being said, I refer to the Mozilla Developer Network very often in my daily routine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Microsoft&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Microsoft&apos;s place in my hierarchy is solely due to work. Google is the true owner of fourth place. Skype used to play a large role in my personal life in that I used it to keep in touch with many people. My usage has been reduced to nothing over the years except. I far prefer FaceTime these days. Though I use Skype daily, what I am using is Skype for Business, which used to be Lync. I think I used Bing once. By mistake. Don&apos;t even get me started on Internet Explorer. At this point, while I hear good things about Windows 10 and Edge, we have not upgraded to them at work yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this on a Macbook. I use almost every single application above (with the notable exception of all Microsoft&apos;s apps) on my iPhone. Almost everything I watch on a TV screen is through an Apple TV. I listen to Apple Music. Anything I can&apos;t find on Netflix I rent through iTunes. Having used Apple software and hardware, I have little desire to ever go back to Windows for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The slightly less frightful, but soon to be Threatening Three&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix - plays a larger role in my life than Facebook, Instagram, YouTube or iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber - As mentioned in a previous post, Uber&apos;s service is fantastic. Though I have serious misgivings about the company itself. With a lack of competitive options in my home country. I don&apos;t see it going anywhere. That is to say if Uber does not self-destruct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbnb - Travel is a large part of my life, and Airbnb plays a vital role in it. I have stayed in Airbnb apartments around the world, and far prefer them to hotels or other, look-a-like services.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uber Alles.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note: This post is a transplant.

&lt;p&gt;What will Attorney General Eric Holder&apos;s report reveal about the culture at Uber?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what effect might the report have not only on the company and its prospects, but on the company&apos;s customers?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber has been in the line of fire this year after numerous reports including, but not limited to, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber&quot;&gt;blog posts about sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Travis Kalanick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/in-video-uber-ceo-argues-with-driver-over-falling-fares&quot;&gt;shouting at an Uber driver&lt;/a&gt; on video, accusations from Alphabet about the alleged &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/2/23/14717432/waymo-otto-uber-anthony-levandowski-lawsuit&quot;&gt;theft of intellectual property related to self-driving vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html&quot;&gt;Greyballing&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, circumventing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html&quot;&gt;Apple&apos;s App Store policies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/uber-groups-visit-to-seoul-escort-bar-sparked-hr-complaint&quot;&gt;visits to brothels&lt;/a&gt; and ensuing attempts to cover them up. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KyleOrl/status/856339201004109824&quot;&gt;disputes over records for Wii Tennis&lt;/a&gt;. To top it all off,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/5/1/15498026/uber-travis-kalanick-arianna-huffington-code-conference&quot;&gt;Kalanick has called off his appearance&lt;/a&gt; at the Code conference later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber, the service, is fantastic! In my home country, unlike in the USA, there are no real alternatives. Lyft does not operate there, neither do any of Uber&apos;s numerous international competitors. As such, while I have serious misgivings about the company itself, what other ride-app options are there? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, if I need a ride, without any meaningful alternatives, I will use Uber because it is the best ride service where I live, regardless of the feelings I have toward the company and its management. Unfortunately, I am sure that many people will feel exactly the same. It seems unlikely that these stories will have a wide scale effect on Uber&apos;s customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can hope that the soon-to-be-released report will lead to re-evaluations and changes in the management team and culture being promoted at Uber. All of these events have happened under the current management&apos;s watch and have resulted in substantial damage to the company image. If I were to consider my own job, if rumours and reports came out about me doing underhanded things and behaving in ways that legitimately threatened the existence of the company, my career would be in serious jeopardy. Is this really the case for Travis Kalanick, Emil Michael, Anthony Levandowski and others at the heart of these controversies? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Kafka writes on Recode about the upcoming report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber’s top executives and board will see it at the very end of May. But the company won’t distribute it to its employees, and explain what its next steps will be, until sometime after that, likely the week of June 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that companies need to manage situations like these at the highest levels, but what does a company do when it is the highest levels that are implicated in the damaging events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To outsiders, Uber looks relatively unchanged from a managerial or cultural perspective. Granted, this may all change once the report comes out. I suspect though, that the real loss for Uber will not be in their image or with their customers in the near term. Rather, these events will have created a sense of blood in the water for their competitors. If the competition was fierce before, the levels are likely to be increased. Where Uber once seemed to be unbeatable, it now seems like they are only ever one controversial step away from scuttling their own ship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Show and Tell.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Amazon has announced the  Echo Show , the recently rumoured Echo device with a screen.

&lt;p&gt;[Video link removed as video is no longer available]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts after watching the video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The acting is pretty bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The demonstrations are convincing and the value proposition is obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The product itself is certainly from the &quot;form follows function&quot; school of design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The white version is odd - why not offer a completely white version?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This product seems, from both the way it looks and the way it operates to be the Alexa-powered love-child of an old TV-monitor and a smartphone. It is however intriguing to consider the spaces, use cases and price points that Amazon is occupying with their collection of Echo devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Echo - Smart speaker ($149.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Echo Dot - Smart speaker minus the speaker (for spreading throughout the home) ($49.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Echo Tap - Portable smart speaker (for travel, picnics etc) ($129.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Echo Look - Smart speaker with a camera ($199.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Echo Show - Smart speak with a screen and a camera ($229.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at Amazon&apos;s Echo products and Alexa services, it certainly seems that Amazon is picking up relevant and significant mindshare in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Updated: 11/05/2017]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, I have included several other home based products for comparison. While the wifi-routers are different devices, there might be the option to combine such products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Home - Smart speaker ($114)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Wifi - Wifi router ($129)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eero - Wifi router ($199)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple TV - Smart TV puck ($149 32GB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Airport Extreme - Wifi router ($199)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Airport Express - Wifi router ($99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[End update]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if/when Apple enters this market and what Google will do to expand on their offerings. What approach will Apple take in the the following respects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pricing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon is certainly taking the the portfolio approach. Considering Apple has been very slow to develop the Apple TV product, it is difficult to see Apple being able to effectively pay attention to such a device. Should they release such a device, it is likely to be just one (at least for quite some time) and it will likely be more expensive than the Echo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Functionality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate as to which voice assistants are the best between Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana. People&apos;s feelings seem to be dictated by personal preference and with their preferred style of interaction. While Apple can certainly justify the higher prices for their computers and mobile devices because the software (MacOS and iOS) are superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when the software (Siri) is just another assistant and is even considered to be inferior? The differentiating factor for Apple is then left with the design of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home is an area that people spend a lot of money on and the &quot;form&quot; of many objects in the home is very important. Apple will certainly find meaningful customers in the home for an attractive and functional device. The tricky point here is, considering that, up until we can have a HAL-like omni-present assistant throughout the home, the multi-device approach is likely to be the better approach in the home when trying to span your entire home. Will these customers want to buy an &quot;Apple speaker/screen/dingus&quot; for every room if the functionality is not where it should be and more expensive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering what products might be most similar to a smart speaker-like device. The Apple TV comes closest. The Apple TV has been a point of disappointment for several customers. While I am certainly happy with mine, I was coming from a background of regular TV. The bar was very low. The majority of potential customers in this market have much higher expectations. There have been very high hopes for the Apple TV, yet the device seems to be only acceptable on most vectors. Considering Siri falls into this &quot;not quite the best of Apple&quot; category - will customers be willing to invest into products Apple is likely not to going to make regular, meaningful updates to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google Home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I do not know much about Google Home. The device seems to be pretty good, if somewhat undifferentiated. One advantage they do have at present is Google Home&apos;s voice identification feature. This feature which recognises different people&apos;s voices stands out from the pack at present. However, this will likely be coming to other platforms soon. Features are easily copied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Apple&apos;s Advantage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is though, that Apple and Siri are with their customer&apos;s everywhere they go. Added to that, Apple customers are very likely to give an &quot;Siri speaker&quot; at least one chance. While advantages in one technological space generally means disadvantages in others. The fact that Alexa/Echo is not with you everywhere you go, means their is a significant gap in the Amazon/Alexa product offering that is not easily filled by the many smart home product players. The continuity that Siri on your iPhone and in your EarPods offers is compelling. While Apple seems to be losing valuable ground in the smart home, there is still opportunity there. How long that opportunity lasts is another question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samsung&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung seem to be conspicuously absent in this space which is strange considering they make a variety of the most expensive home appliances. That is without considering their purchase of Harman. Samsung are able to make and price products of almost every kind and in every price point. However, their efforts with Bixby on their latest Galaxy flagship seem to leave much to be desire and their purchase of Viv is yet to bear fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung look to be taking a leaf out of the failed Nokia/build-your-own-OS playbook here rather than Samsung&apos;s own transformative Android playbook. Samsung are trying to differentiate in an area they are not skilled in. This is a mistake by Samsung in this market. Would it not be better for them to leverage Alexa along with their existing product strengths than to try and forge their own platform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, not being able to differentiate themselves on the level of software is a thorn in Samsung&apos;s side when it comes to smartphones. None the less, they have succeeded admirably in the smartphone market. I see no reason not to take a similar approach in the home market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alexa in your ears&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I suspect that one area Amazon could be looking to leapfrog their &quot;always with you&quot; gap is by pushing the Echo into the in-ear/wearable speaker space. While wearables certainly take a level of finesse, nuance and expertise in software and hardware that only Apple has been able to display to date, surely such a product must be on Amazon&apos;s mind. That gap in experience Echo/Alexa customers have when they aren&apos;t home is a big one, and is prime territory for Apple or Samsung to enter through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Iterations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still relatively early days in the voice assistant and product space, however, the speed with which Amazon is iterating will be difficult to match considering Apple&apos;s slow and deliberate pace. Even if someone can match Amazon on that vector, Amazon&apos;s ability to monetise outside of the product itself, will be even harder to compete with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things happen fairly slowly, you know. They do. These waves of technology, you can see them way before they happen, and you just have to choose wisely which ones you&apos;re going to surf. If you choose unwisely, then you can waste a lot of energy, but if you choose wisely it actually unfolds fairly slowly. It takes years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our biggest insights [years ago] was that we didn&apos;t want to get into any business where we didn&apos;t own or control the primary technology because you&apos;ll get your head handed to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2013 and Ben Thompson wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; explaining that much of Apple&apos;s current attitude towards developers and the business models afforded to those developers was moulded by Apple&apos;s difficult experiences with Office and Photoshop. Ben wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble for Apple – or any platform provider – is apps that cross that line from nice-to-have to completely irreplaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward again to 2017 and Ben Thompson (you should subscribe to his daily updates) writes another great piece about &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/apples-china-problem/&quot;&gt;Apple&apos;s China Problem&lt;/a&gt;. The crux of the piece is summed up best when he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental issue is this: unlike the rest of the world, in China the most important layer of the smartphone stack is not the phone’s operating system. Rather, it is WeChat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Ben, we can start to see that it is no longer Apple that is irreplaceable in China but WeChat. By extension, WeChat is then central to continued success in China. If WeChat represents the problem, what is the solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer might lie in reading those two paragraphs from Steve Jobs in reverse order. With specific focus on the analogy of the wave. Let&apos;s look at it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a growing wave of dissatisfaction with the stringent control Apple exerts on the App Store. Apple carves 30% out of every purchase. (This is acceptable to Apple, as long as the developer&apos;s customers are not willing to leave the store along with the developers in large numbers.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a growing wave of business models that are enabled not only by larger payments, but by many smaller payments. Taking 30% out of these, or charging each time one is made is not sustainable to the developers or their customers. (As shown by WeChat&apos;s tipping feature)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These waves are still coming and have not broken...yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Steve&apos;s quote does not reveal is that, while waves can be seen coming for quite some time. Once a wave has gathered pace, if you are not in the right place to meet it, that waves passes you by no matter how long you have been watching it or how hard you paddle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better to catch a big wave with someone else, than to watch them ride it all the way to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, there are always more waves. You might just have to wait a long time for a wave as big as China.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite being kind of creepy, there could be something to this device. Voice computing in the home (and car) certainly feels like it could be the next &quot;thing&quot; in technology. The primary limitation here is that these devices are anchored (to an Echo, Echo Look, Google Home etc). An &quot;omnipresent&quot; device, available throughout the entire house, carried over to the car or to your phone should be the goal for this type of platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Style Check&quot;, a feature that lets you compare outfits with a fashion specialist seems like it could be more valuable if you are able to &quot;Style Check&quot; with your friends or family via a messaging app. Considering the popularity of makeover TV shows, the potential angle for &quot;makeovers for everyone&quot; is significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This functionality in concert with some type of express fast-food-like delivery could be hugely successful. Last minute outfit dramas are definitely a struggle for many women (and men) when going out, to work or even just for a jog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The possibility of switching backgrounds using augmented reality capabilities, for example, switching the background of your wardrobe to a beach, when trying on or shopping for a bikini are one possible extension for such a device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This type of functionality could also be valuable in a smartphone app. With the advancements in augmented reality capabilities and the proliferation of selfie-sticks, it is not hard to imagine a mobile version of such an app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some serious privacy concerns around a camera like this - what happens if someone hacks/watches your camera?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Echo with a screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rumoured &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aftvnews.com/exclusive-this-is-amazons-new-echo-with-a-built-in-touchscreen/&quot;&gt;Echo with a screen&lt;/a&gt;&quot; also seems like it could be a convincing (and ugly - if the screenshots are to be believed) device. Unplanned meals and deciding what to cook in conjunction with a lack of ingredients in your cupboard and fridge is &quot;prime&quot; territory for Amazon to step into with an express delivery service. Delivering shortly before educating and instructing you on how to prepare the dish via voice and video certainly sounds like a winning combination. (Such a device could also be useful in a home workshop or creative studio).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hardware differentiated by services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly feels that while Apple has succeeded through hardware differentiated by software - Amazon&apos;s real advantage is going to be hardware differentiated by services.&lt;/p&gt;

As a long-time Windows user, the effort however seems to be on the wrong vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I switched was not based on hardware, but software. I got tired of Windows and its lack of speed. What initially struck me when using a Mac was how quickly and smoothly it worked. That being said, the &quot;locked-down&quot; Windows 10S announcement is more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locking the laptop down to applications only available on the Windows Store seems to be akin to the iOS App Store. The more direct comparison would be to the Mac App Store. The Mac App Store has struggled to gain traction with notable developers and in many ways the Mac App Store has been a failure. Primarily because there are marquee applications not available in that store. This lack of marquee applications will certainly be the case with Windows Store. Why then would Microsoft pursue this avenue when their hardware efforts seem focused on high-end customers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they going after the education market increasingly dominated by Chromebooks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they want to exert the level of control (and extract the % of sales) that Apple does on iOS in the App Store?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, both of those points seem to contradict the high-end approach Microsoft seems to be taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&apos;s control and lack of sustainable business models on the App Store have in particular led to the handicapping of the iPad and have irked developers. The Mac App Store has achieved similar results with developers expressly not putting their application in the store. These developers themselves tend to be high-end customers. Locking down a laptop to a be Windows Store only is in opposition to the needs of the high-end market, who will definitely be using and require applications that are not in the Windows Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations Microsoft is placing on the customer in terms of forcing them to use Edge and Bing in this instance also seem to be user hostile. Many Windows users use Windows because it is flexible and more &quot;open&quot; than Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The education market is decidedly not high-end. So which customer is Microsoft trying to serve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things considered, it is good that Microsoft is making the effort. For many years Microsoft stagnated and they are beginning to regain relevance with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a product-related note, the fabric around the keyboard seems like it might be nice to the touch. Certainly an interesting choice - impractical as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what of that video? Impressive as they are, how many more of these &quot;construction in motion&quot; videos with Holi-Festival-like colour explosions will we see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Video link removed as it is no longer available]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are Apple able to implement a TouchID sensor ring on glass? (Regarding placement - a sensor on the front is best. A sensor on the back is acceptable.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do the light and proximity sensors move to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do they move the front-facing receiver/microphone while maintaining sound quality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens with the device to display relationship and its effect on battery life? (Maintain display size with a smaller phone. Maintain phone size and increase display size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the FaceTime camera is covered by pixels, are Apple able to implement a camera through the screen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
