{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Despite my renewed interest in design work, I have experienced some \"design block\" the past few days. I have been working at design, but I was not making much progress. I kept at it, and in the end, what got me through, was working from another base. I took a UI design kit, found something that was along the lines of what I wanted and then started using it to apply my <em>failing</em> designs to. I then started adapting my logo, colours and fonts to the new approach and I suddenly started making progress. </p>\n<p>The point is that, whenever you are stuck, it helps take a new approach. Rather than just sitting and spinning wheels. Think about other means by which you can get to where you need to be? Look for inspiration, look for designs, or pages that fit what you are looking for. Mix and match elements, colours, shapes and fonts to see if you get something you like. At minimum, you will get some new ideas and maximum, you will break through your barrier and make progress in the right direction. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Design Block."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0106/"}}
