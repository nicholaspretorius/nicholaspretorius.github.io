{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I first started using Audible in 2015. Since then, I have completed listening to 42 titles amounting to a staggering 1 month, 1 day, 6 hours and 5 minutes of listening time to date. The vast majority of which was spent while commuting back and forth to work. In recent time, I have also started listening to Audible during \"in between time\", such as while shaving, or changing, or washing the dishes. Things like that. </p>\n<p>To anyone who has not given listening to audiobooks I try, I heartily recommend it. Commuting and traffic sucks. The thing is though, while listening to audiobooks, especially good ones, the traffic and the frustration that might arise from it just melts away as you make your way through innumerable adventures and stories. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Audible."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0105/"}}
