{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>If you are in the Johannesburg area and have the benefit or flexibility of working from a distributed or remote office, I highly recommend making a visit to <a href=\"https://perchoffices.co.za/\">Perch</a>. </p>\n<p>Perch is right across the road from Rosebank shopping mall, next to the Tyrwhitt Hotel. Perch is located inside an office building shared with several other businesses and is right next to the Rosebank Mall parking. If have a car and park there, it is a very short walk from there or a slightly longer walk from the Gautrain station (still under 500m). </p>\n<p>From the second floor of the building, the Perch offices take up two floors. The lower floor is the more flexible, open spaces where the day, or occassional visitors are located. The upper floor is mostly boardrooms and the longer term co-workers who get dedicated desks for a month or more. </p>\n<p>When you are arrive, you will check-in and be given a tour of the premises if it is your first visit. There is a coffee shop in the office, boardrooms, \"phone booth\"-type spaces for making calls and there are plenty of desks, chairs and spaces to choose from in the nicely appointed and furnished space. </p>\n<p>High ceilings and a lot of natural light make the space feel very comfortable. Their aircon keeping the office at a good temperature and the internet is reliable and fast. The coffee was good and so was the service! </p>\n<p>I would not hesitate to recommend it. Best of all, your first day is free, you just need to claim your space on the website! They even pay for your parking on your free day!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Perch."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0156/"}}
