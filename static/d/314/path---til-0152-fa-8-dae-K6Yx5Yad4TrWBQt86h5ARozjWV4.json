{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Auth0's \"silent authentication\" feature enables you to automatically log users back into SPA's (single page applications) after a page refresh. If you are using the default username and password authenticaiton functionality, then, if the user is logged in when the page refreshes, the \"silent authentication\" will automatically log the user back in on page refresh. </p>\n<p>When you activate the Google social login on Auth0, which enables the user to log in via Google with their Google details, the user will <em>not</em> be automatically logged in on page refresh. At first I thought this was due to my app running on <code>localhost</code>, however, it turns out that the auto-login does not happen because Auth0 is using their default Google OAuth developer keys. In order to enable the \"silent authentication\" feature with Google logins, you need to enable your own Google API details. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, Auth0 provides a <a href=\"https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/google\">useful tutorial</a> explaining the process and it is very easy to setup!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Google OAuth with Auth0."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0152/"}}
