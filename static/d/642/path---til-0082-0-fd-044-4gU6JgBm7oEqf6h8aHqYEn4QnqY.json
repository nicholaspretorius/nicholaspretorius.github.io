{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Microservices are certainly a hot topic at present. One of my current project is in early planning stages for moving from one large monolith with many developers to many small microservices with the many developers split up into dedicated teams focusing on microservices. </p>\n<p>While I understand the concept of microservices in theory, I have never actually built or worked on an application with such an architecture. To date, every app I have worked on has been a single deployment monolith. Granted, on one of my primary projects, I started work in the direction of microservices by splitting out functionality into separate smaller apps, but due to inexperience and a lack of knowledge on the topic, it is not a true microservices architecture. </p>\n<p>As a result, I have started delving into the world of Node.js microservices and I am really excited about the possibilities! It feels like I am starting to level-up my skills and taking another step towards becoming a better developer in an exciting area of modern development!  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting Microservices."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0082/"}}
