{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Google recently announced it's new gaming streaming service called <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/stadia/stadia-a-new-way-to-play/\">Stadia</a>. While there seems to be much confusion, consternation and possibly even anticipation for the service from gamers and developers. I for one, am curious and possibly interested in such a service if I had a suitable internet connection. While I have not played games in many years. Neither serious games nor casual, mobile games. I do think it would be fun to play some serious games again. When I was a teenager, I was a big fan of first-person shooters like Doom, Quake, Jedi Knight, Half-life etc. I also really enjoyed Diablo, Starcraft and Warcraft II and III as well as some others. </p>\n<p>As I got older, I lost interest in games, primarily because I was pretty active outdoors and socially and the time and money investment good games required was not high on my priority list. As I got older, there were times I considered trying games again, but similar to before, deciding on and investing the time and money into a better PC, graphics card or console just seemed more than the level of interest I harboured. </p>\n<p>Stadia, however, promises the opportunity to play these games without the required financial investment. Sure, you need to pay for the subscription, but for someone such as myself, who is on-the-fence in terms of really committing, it sounds like an attractive proposition. </p>\n<p>That being said, I am interested to see what Microsoft comes up with in this space. Regardless, for the first time in many years, I am curious to see what happens in the gaming world. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Stadia."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post032/"}}
