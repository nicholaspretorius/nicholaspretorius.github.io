{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I started experimenting with React earlier this year and then a few weeks ago, decided to really dig into the topic. I was interested in the framework from a few perspectives: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having worked in the \"AngularJs/Angular\" world for several years, I was curious about how React would be to use in a real project. i.e. Not reading other people's viewpoints on it. </li>\n<li>Anecdotally, it seems to me that most job openings internationally, especially in the US and Silicon Valley seem to be React-leaning. I don't have any data to back this up, but when looking at companies that could comprise a wishlist of companies to work for, they all seemed to be in favour of React. </li>\n<li>With my burgeoning interest in mobile development, the realtionship between React and React Native and how those skills might cross-pollinate made for an attractive topic. </li>\n<li>From my basic introductions to React, my feeling is that React somehow feels more JavaScript-<em>y</em> somehow. </li>\n<li>The \"Typescript\" factor seems to me moving into the React world in a real way, and I am curious whether my experience working with TypeScript in Angular and Nest.js will make a transition to React easier for me, or harder. </li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"React Reasoning."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0115/"}}
