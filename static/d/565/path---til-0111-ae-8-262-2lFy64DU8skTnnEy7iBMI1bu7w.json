{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>.nvmrc</h3>\n<p>I have been using .nvmrc files to keep track of which Node version I am using in an app. The thing is, the VS Code Terminal does not pick-up on the file and switch the Node version automatically. As a result, I am often need to manually check the file and switch my node version via: <code>nvm use v&#x3C;Version></code>.</p>\n<p>This seemed like the perfect opportunity to look into remedying this scenario since it is annoying to run a command only to have it throw errors back at you for using the wrong Node or npm version. A Google search lead me to this <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-tech-bench/getting-visual-studio-code-and-nvm-working-together-252ec0300895\">piece</a>.</p>\n<p>I'll be honest, my eyes started glazing over halfway through. Over the years, my use and appreciation of the terminal has elevated dramatically. The challenge I have is, I still have trouble parsing commands liek this: </p>\n<p><code>~/.nvm/nvm-exec which node | xargs -J % ln -sf % ./.nvm-node &#x26;&#x26; chmod +x ./.nvm-node</code></p>\n<p>This exposes the hole in my knowledge of terminal. Improving my knowledge and proficiency of terminal commands has been on my todo list, along with sharpening up my knowledge of Regular Expressions. Unfortunately, despite making improvements, these items tend to slip down my list of priorities in favour of shinier toys. </p>\n<p>I need to do it though. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"VS Code and .nvmrc"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0111/"}}
