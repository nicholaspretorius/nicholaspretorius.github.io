{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Last year I came across a blog post by Michael Herman titled (\"Flask for Node Developers\")[https://mherman.org/blog/flask-for-node-developers/]. Following along with that tutorial was the first time I used Python. Since then, I have completed two of Michael's fuller fledged courses. Namely: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-flask/\">Test-Driven Development with Python, Flask and Docker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://testdriven.io/courses/auth-flask-react/\">Authentication with Flask, React and Docker</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are an aspiring Python (or React) developer and want a solid introduction into how to develop in a truly test-driven approach that combines everything up into a modern, Dockerized, CI/CD workflow I highly recommend his courses! </p>\n<p>The is a third course in the series titled <a href=\"https://testdriven.io/courses/aws-flask-react/\">Deploying a Flask and React Microservice to AWS</a> which I have not done yet, but I will in the near future! </p>\n<p>The great thing is that all three courses are expansions on the same application, so you really get a thorough work through of some real world scenarios. The difficulty with many tutorials out there is that they are very limited in scope. If you want something with a little more meat on the bones, video courses tend to be your best bet, but very few courses (that I have seen) take a true test-driven approach to development. It seems a little odd when you think about it because, taking a look at job posts and boards, unit testing is often one of the primary requirements yet there are relatively few courses that actually deal with unit testing or TDD itself. </p>\n<p>My feeling is that Michael and his team have hit on a very valuable approach, I look forward to seeing what courses they release in the future! </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Testdriven.io."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0147/"}}
