This meant I need to update the naming I used in my services to things such as <code>GATEWAY_PORT</code> and <code>DB_PORT</code> as opposed to just PORT in the separate packages. </p>\n<p>Transitioning to PM2 from a simple nodemon setup takes some getting used to and means you need to get comfortable with viewing and navigating output and error log files. You will find these in your user folder under .pm2/logs. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"PM2 Commands."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0086/"}}
