{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>After much reading of documentation and GitHub issues I have realised the following: </p>\n<p>Personal GitHub account/GitHub pages do not have access to a gh-pages branch nor a /docs folder in master.</p>\n<h4>gh-pages and /docs.</h4>\n<p>User accounts <em>only</em> have access to a master branch, meaning index.html will be served from there. This puts the brakes on my plans to incorporate a Circle CI build into this workflow for the moment and leaves with a rather messy private repo which is not in sync with my true repo. I will need to look into how to resolve this since at present, my <em>true</em> master branch contains the Gatsby source files along with the markdown files that are the source of these blog posts. </p>\n<p>The problem is that the GitHub repo is now actually the /public folder, which is not really what I want to keep in source control since it muddies up the repo. Use of a /docs folder would have resolved this for me, but alas, my account does not allow for it. </p>\n<p>I took a very brief look at the options when adding a new repo, as well as for signing up a 'Project' on GitHub, but I am not quite sure how or where this is defined. It seems to me that I will need to look into alternatives for hosting my development blog since GitHub Pages does not quite suit my needs when it comes to managing and serving the code. </p>\n<h4>Folder Structure.</h4>\n<p>Another topic I took a look into was moving all my .md files into their own folder within my 'src' folder. This only half-worked, since it seems to mess up the routing of my links as well as the build at times. I will need to look into this further because it bugs me that I have .js files mixed in amongst a whole lot of .md files. Anyway, its a nice-to-have so I will get to it at some point. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gatsby and Circle CI (Part 2)."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0052/"}}
