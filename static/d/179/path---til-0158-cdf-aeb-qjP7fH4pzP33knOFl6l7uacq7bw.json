{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://www.cypress.io/\">Cypress</a>. For someone that had never done end-to-end testing before, I find it both familiar, and intuitive. Which is not the feeling I have while unit testing. Admittdely, using <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro\">React Testing Library</a> feels more intuitive to me since it is more focused on how the application will really be used, which feels more natural to me. </p>\n<p>Regardless, a tip I picked up recently was that you can set the base url for the application in your <code>cypress.json</code> file as follows: </p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"baseUrl\": \"http://localhost:3000\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will then enable you to use urls in Cypress like this: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>cy.visit(\"/\")</code></li>\n<li><code>cy.visit(\"/about\")</code></li>\n<li><code>cy.visit(\"/contact\")</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Very useful!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Useful Cypress Tip."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0158/"}}
