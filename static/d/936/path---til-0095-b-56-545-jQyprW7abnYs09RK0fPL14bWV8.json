{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have been trying out <a href=\"https://www.substack.com\">Substack</a>. In short, it is a subscription email newsletter/blog service that enables you to write and publish newsletters quickly, easily and charge for them (via Stripe) if you like. They are also busy experimenting with delivering podcasts too. </p>\n<p>Thoughts: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The editor is clean and minimal - I like it.</li>\n<li>There is no \"Saves as Draft\" button. Which is terribly weird and confusing. </li>\n<li>The \"one line description\" of the site is not displayed - also confusing. (Maybe it appears if you upload a logo?)</li>\n<li>The customisation options are limited, but considering this is a beta and MVP, understood. </li>\n<li>Are there RSS feeds?</li>\n<li>The editor does not make it obvious how to add the various social media embeds. </li>\n<li>A 'dark mode' would be nice!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I like the product. It is simple and staightforward. The look and feel reminds me of Medium to some extent, but this is not a bad thing. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Substack."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0095/"}}
