Once the reviews drop, we can expect plenty of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is too expensive.</li>\n<li>Siri is worse than Alexa/Assistant/Cortana.</li>\n<li>I cannot do X, Y or Z on HomePod.</li>\n<li>The sound isn't as good as X, Y, Z.</li>\n<li>Apple is doomed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the meantime, I will be looking forward to reading about (and eventually hearing) how good of speaker it is.</p>\n<p>2 years ago I bought a JBL Charge 3 for my girlfriend. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made. It sounds good, it's portable, the battery lasts a good while and it is even waterproof. One thing it is not, is smart or have a voice. While the JBL Charge 3 is great, I am looking for something a little more permanent to pair with the Apple TV in the lounge while the JBL Charge 3 can go in the bedroom or go with us on holiday. As far as I am concerned, any smart/voice features are all upside. The jobs to be done in my case are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Music</li>\n<li>Audio for video</li>\n<li>Podcasts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would not underestimate the value of a good speaker. The real test will be to see how HomePod compares to higher end speakers and audio systems. It is interesting to consider HomePod not as an over-priced, under-featured voice assistant, but rather as a low-end entrant to the high-end audio market.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pre-HomePod."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post022/"}}
