{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I recently discovered <a href=\"https://bikeparkatuitsig.co.za/\">The Bike Park</a> in Constantia. Situated on the Uitsig wine farm, the park consists of a number of dirt trails to ride your mountain bike or BMX on. There are a number of trails consisting of a variety of terrain made up of dirt pump tracks, berms, table-top jumps, rollers, hips and various other constructions including a treeline bridge ride (with a corckscrew exit) and a large wooden berm. There is also a bike/rental shop that offers gear, repairs, rentals and even coffee. </p>\n<p>Looking back to my childhood, without a doubt, the best gift I ever received was one Christmas I got a BMX. Needless to say, I rode that thing non-stop for the entire holiday. Over the years, I have been on a few mountain bike rides. I enjoy riding bikes, and it is an especially fun way to see cities while travelling. I enjoy it enough, that a few months ago, I purchased a work colleagues old mountain bike. A red and black Scott mountain bike with shocks on the front. I have taken the bike out a few times, and decided to bring it along on my road trip since it was likely I would find plenty of good spots to ride. So far, this has been a good decision, but not until the bike park, did I realise just how good. </p>\n<p>I doubt that any bike riding experience will ever match up to when I first got my bike as a kid. I think that combination of excitement, joy and surprise at receiving something that activates your sense of adventure and freedom like a bicycle does as a child would be hard to match. Riding at the bike park came close though!</p>\n<p>It is ridiculously fun to ride laps upon laps of terrain, cruising through bermed corners, rolling over humps and learning to hit jumps on a bike after all these years. Admittedly, I was most attracted to learning to try and air my bike over the two small table-top jumps and trying to get faster and lower through the berms, but I think, on some level, going hell for leather at these features is as close to that child-like bicycle riding experience on can get. </p>\n<p>That, or it could have been seeing a father and his little son tearing around the track full speed, hollering and wooping, having the time of their lives that reminded me of that experience. Regardless, if you are a parent, looking for a place to have fun with your kids, look no further than The Bike Park in Constantia. The trails are varied enough that there is something for everyone and every skill level, and due to the layout of the park, you are never too far from any corner of it (unlike other mountain bike trails which can be very long). Chances are, you will have just as much fun as your kids will! </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fun."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post043/"}}
