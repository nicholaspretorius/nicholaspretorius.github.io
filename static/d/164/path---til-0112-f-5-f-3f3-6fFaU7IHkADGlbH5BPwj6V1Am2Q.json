{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>Google Sheets Cheat Sheet.</h3>\n<p>While I have been a longtime user of Google Sheets. My usage has not been very deep. Mostly just making lists of things I like to keep track of. However, with the discovery of the wonderful app called Glide, my usage of Google Sheets has increased dramatically! </p>\n<h4>Filter.</h4>\n<p>Filter is a very useful formula enabling you to <em>filter</em> your view of data. For example: </p>\n<p><code>=filter(SheetName!A:E,Sheet!E:E=TRUE)</code></p>\n<p>This will pull data in from columns A to E in SheetName and will then display all items that have a value of TRUE in Column E of that same sheet. </p>\n<h4>Unique.</h4>\n<p>Unique enables you to pull out <em>unique</em> values from a list of values. For example: </p>\n<p><code>=UNIQUE(SheetName!I2:I)</code></p>\n<p>This will pull all unique values in from SheetName Column I from rows 2 to as many rows as I contains. </p>\n<h4>Sort.</h4>\n<p>Sort lets you, well, <em>sort</em> data in your sheet. I tend to use it to sort data from another sheet. For example: </p>\n<p><code>=SORT(SheetName!A2:F, 4, true)</code></p>\n<p>This will sort data from SheetName in the range of Columns A to F.</p>\n<p>To be continued...</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Sheets."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0112/"}}
