{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>It suprising to me how effective the little coloured circles are on the Activity Tracker on the Apple Watch. Ever since I bought the Apple Watch in December last year, I have been making sure to keep up with my activity goals by completing the Exercise, Stand and Move circles every day. </p>\n<p>I find collecting the circles and maintaining the streak strangely satisfying. It is easy to miss days of activity when you don't see the gaps in your progress. Without the visual reminder, it far too easy to let one day merge into three days, which in turn can easily merge into a week and pretty soon you are a few weeks into a slump in activity without really realising how long it has been.  </p>\n<p>Granted, it can be tiresome on days where you don't feel the energy or desire to exercise, but more often than not, that annoying reminder or the incomplete circle is enough to get you on your feet and out the door!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Little Coloured Circles."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0091/"}}
