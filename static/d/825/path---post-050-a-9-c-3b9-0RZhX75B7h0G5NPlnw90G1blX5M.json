{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I was sitting in a restaurant and overheard a person at the table next to me saying that they heard a rumour (I don't know from where), that the a new Samsung phone will somehow automatically be able to open the camera immediately. At first I thought this sounded a bit strange, but as I thought about it, having a much quicker way to open the camera on a smartphone is a really good idea. </p>\n<p>Granted, being an iPhone user, one only needs to swipe right from the home screen in order to access the camera, regardless of whether it is locked, but this itself is not foolproof. Just yesterday, I was on an open top tourbus and wanted to quickly snap a picture of something and I somehow fumbled the lock screen which instead of opening the camera, activated Face ID and then opened to the home screen, where I then need to remind myself where on the home screen my camera app sat (since I typically just access from lock screen) and by the time I found it, the moment had passed. </p>\n<p>Sure, it is not a big deal that I missed the photo, but the reality is that sometimes this matters to people and any improvement that could be made to this process to make it faster and more reliable to access the camera would be valuable. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cameras Access."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post050/"}}
