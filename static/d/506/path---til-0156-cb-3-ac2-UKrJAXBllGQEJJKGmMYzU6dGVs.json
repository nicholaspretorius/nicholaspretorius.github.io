{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>If you are in the Johannesburg area and have the benefit or flexibility of working from a distributed or remote office, I highly recommend making a visit to <a href=\"https://perchoffices.co.za/\">Perch</a>. </p>\n<p>Perch is right across the road from Rosebank shopping mall, next to the Thyrwhitt Hotel. Their office building is right next to the mall parking, so it is a short walk from there or from the Gautrain station. On the second floor of the building, the Perch offices take up two floors. When you are arrive, you will check-in and be given a tour of the premises if it is your first visit. There is a coffee shop in the office, there are plenty of desks and space in a very nicely furnished space. </p>\n<p>You have a variety of desks, chair and spaces to choose from. High ceilings and lots of natural light make the space feel very comfortable. The internet is fast, the coffee was good and so was the service! </p>\n<p>I would not hesitate to recommend it. Best of all, your first day is free, you just need to claim your space on the website. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Perch."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0156/"}}
