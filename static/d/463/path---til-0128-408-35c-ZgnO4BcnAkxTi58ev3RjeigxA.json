{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I went wakeskating today again for the only the second time this season. The past few weeks have been tricky for me, I have had some problems with lower back pain which has kept my activity levels to the lowest they have been all year. It has been frustrating, and while my focus has been on learning new things on the programming side, the lack of physical activity has not been great. Since I have had some back issues in the past, I did not want to rush recovery and it has made me careful about getting back on the water. Today felt good though, I rode the new feature in the park a few times, landing it was a real boost of confidence. During last week's ride I also landed a trick I only learnt on the last day of last season which was also a high for me. While I am not yet back to where I was last season, all things considered, I think things are off to a decent start!  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Back On The Water."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0128/"}}
