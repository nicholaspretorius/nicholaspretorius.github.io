For some more detailed information on the topic, you can't go wrong with the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\">CSS Tricks Guide to Flexbox</a></p>\n<p>The reason I have been revisting the topic is because Flexbox is the way that React Native powers layouts. While the CSS Tricks guide has been a goto resource for years, I had never encountered Flexbox Froggy before. Worth a few minutes of diversion. </p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, since Flexbox is the default for React Native and as a result is attuned to mobile/vertical phone layouts, there are a few differences to regular web-based Flexbox defaults: </p>\n<pre><code>flex-direction: column;\nbox-sizing: border-box;\nposition: relative;\nalign-items: stretch;\nflex-shrink: 0;\nalign-content: flex-start;\nborder: 0 solid black;\nmargin: 0;\npadding: 0;\nmin-width: 0;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And dimensions in React Native are unitless. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Flexbox Froggy."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0131/"}}
