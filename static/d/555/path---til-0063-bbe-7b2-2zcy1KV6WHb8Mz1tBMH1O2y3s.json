{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Over the past few days I have been going through several 'official' introductory tutorials. </p>\n<h4>Ionic</h4>\n<p>Last week I spent some time doing a basic Ionic app based on what I did for an Angular todo app. Having some familiarity with Ionic, I went through the official <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/tutorial/\">Ionic tutorial</a>. Of the tutorials I have gone through recently, this was the most disappointing since it was not so much a tutorial as it was a walk-through of the code generated by the Ionic CLI. It was interesting to me to see how heavily Ionic uses Angular, and the example app provided is useful and relevant. The rub is that it was not a \"tutorial\" as such. You do not write any code, nor build anything on top of the provided starter theme. My feeling is that there could be a lot more value learning and development-wise in having an actual tutorial where you build an example, rudimentary application on top of the starter app. So far, both Angular and React tutorials are better. </p>\n<p>What did stand out in terms of Ionic was their excellent <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#overview\">component library guide</a>. The Components are cleanly presented with a mobile view on the right which lets you toggle between iOS, Android and Windows Phone views of the Ionic components demonstrating how each component looks and operates in the different environment alongside the code usage on the left. While the information and presentation was great, what I really <em>loved</em> where the examples! All the examples were heavily pop-culture-inspired with reference to Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and many more which made going through the examples a lot more fun than they might have been otherwise! I really enjoyed going through component guide and it made me excited to spend more time working with Ionic. Especially since I can leverage and expand on my existing Angular knowledge. </p>\n<h4>Vue</h4>\n<p>I have started going through the <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Getting-Started\">Vue docs</a>, however, as far as I can see, there is no official tutorial as such. There is a link to a free Vue course on a site called Vue Mastery where it looks as though they take you through building a page on an example e-commerce site. However, the docs themselves take the approach of various separate, standalone code examples rather than going through a step-by-step build of an example application. Personally, I prefer a text based, step-by-step tutorial where you can build 'something' in an hour or two as opposed to disparate examples or a video course. </p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, I am a big believer in online courses, and I have found immense value in doing several online courses. However, context is important and onlie video courses are very time intensive, and, what I am currently looking to do is complete a tutorial that within a few hours will take me through building an example app which will demonstrate the various building blocks of the framework. </p>\n<p>I will need to stick with the Vue docs for a while to see if a more cohesive example or tutorial is presented. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Those Tutorials."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0063/"}}
