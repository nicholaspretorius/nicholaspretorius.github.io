{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Now that I am getting going with Sketch again. Below are some notes on my setup:</p>\n<h3>Sketch Version.</h3>\n<p>I had long since upgraded my version, as such, I bought a new license and upgraded to the latest version which is 53 (at the time of writing). </p>\n<h3>Source Control.</h3>\n<p>For source control, I decided to try out <a href=\"https://versions.sympli.io/\">Versions by Sympli</a>. <a href=\"https://www.goabstract.com/\">Abstract</a> seems to be the preferred tool from designers I know, however, working as a solo designer at this point, I do not feel the need to use this yet. After some investigation, I settled on Versions since it is Git based and free.</p>\n<h3>Plugins</h3>\n<p>After some investigation, I installed the following plugins to assist with workflow: </p>\n<h4>Sketch Runner.</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://sketchrunner.com/\">Sketch Runner</a> is a fantastic plugin! It reminds me of CMD + P in VS Code or Spotlight on Mac. </p>\n<h4>Craft by InVision.</h4>\n<p>I have long been a fan of <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\">InVision</a> for creating clickable prototypes (aka clickdummies), so it made sense to give <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> a shot.</p>\n<h4>Sketch Palettes.</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes\">Sketch Palettes</a> is a simple plugin to manage and import color palettes with support for colours, gradients and pattern fills. </p>\n<h4>Content Generator.</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/timuric/Content-generator-sketch-plugin\">Content Generator</a> has some overlap with Craft, but I like the simplicity of it. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sketch Setup."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0101/"}}
