{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Blogs have been a huge part of my online and learning experience over the years. I still read an enormous amount via RSS feeds of my favourite blogs. Blogs might be \"old fashioned\", but I am an avid reader and fan of them. Blogs, are very much the pre-cursor to the current rising podcast trend. Most successfull bloggers have podcasts. What I love about RSS is that, it is like you have a direct line into the mind of some of the most intelligent, smart and interesting people out there. On a regular basis, you receive pieces of their their thought process, their insights, and the way their thinking on certain topics evolves over time. </p>\n<p>If you think about it, few of us, will ever get the opportunity to pick the brains of the brightest and smartest out there, or to have a conversation with them. However, by subscribing to their blog via RSS or email or however you choose to follow a blog, you get a similar type of scenario, but extended and elaborated over time. </p>\n<p>I cannot overstate the value of this in my life. That I have had the opportunity to, in a sense, be a fly on the wall to the ongoing through processes and outputs of some really smart people out there. </p>\n<p>In that same light, I want to begin to try it for myself. To write repeatedly, and regularly and put the words and thoughts out there. One of the blogs I follow, AVC, is written on the daily by venture capitalist Fred Wilson. As I understand it, he sits down to write his daily post every morning before he gets started with his day. I am going to attempt to do the same. I am a big believer in habits and habit building and this is a habit I want to add to my daily process. Before I start my work for the day, I am going to write a post on a topic on my mind. This is the first. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Habit Building."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post027/"}}
