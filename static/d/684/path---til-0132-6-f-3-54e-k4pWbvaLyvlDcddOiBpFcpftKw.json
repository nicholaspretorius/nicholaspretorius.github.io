{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Ionic has announced <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/blog/announcing-ionic-react/\">Ionic React</a>! While Ionic has long been known as an \"Angular\" framework for building mobile apps using web technology, it looks as though they are expanding beyond their Angular origins. Earlier this year I started experimenting with Ionic and, coming from an Angular background, I enjoyed working with it. After having spent the past few weeks digging into the React and React Native ecosystems, I am very curious how Ionic React will fit into the overall ecosystem. </p>\n<p>What I am most intrigued by is that Ionic React comes with TypeScript baked in which, at a glance, makes Ionic React look quite familiar to someone with experience with Ionic. An Ionic team member has also posted a guide on <a href=\"https://dev.to/elylucas/adding-ionic-react-to-an-existing-react-project-4kib\">how to integrate Ionic React into an existing React project</a>. </p>\n<p>I will be going through some examples soon! </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ionic React."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0132/"}}
