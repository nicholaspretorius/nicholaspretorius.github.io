{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have been a longtime reader of Fred Wilson's blog, <a href=\"https://avc.com/\">AVC</a>. Over the years, it has started to become one of my favourite reads and I look forward to his posts on a daily basis. His recent post <a href=\"https://avc.com/2019/01/capitalism-and-inequality/\">Capitalism and Inequality</a> stuck with me for different reasons than usual though. It succeeded as a thought provoking piece, but I felt it missed the mark. </p>\n<p>Take the remarkable <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yedfKGZ7do\">closing credits</a> of the 2010 comedy <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386588/\">The Other Guys</a>. In particular, the animation that records the exponentially growing ratio of CEO to average employee. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>In 1921, the credits list the ratio as 9:1. </li>\n<li>By 2010 the ratio was 319:1. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the average CEO salary has multiplied over 35 times between 1921 - 2010, how many times has the average employee's salary multiplied? </p>\n<p>Executives* have within their immediate power, the ability to address the inequality of that 319-1 pay ratio. The inability or unwillingness to do so is immoral. </p>\n<p>*<em>I use the term executives to represent <code>those with power</code> in companies. They could be founders, CEOs, C-level executives, board members, investors or similar</em></p>\n<p><em>Additionally, consider the ~reward~ punishment Google dished out to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html\">Andy Rubin</a>... That treatment of those who are considered special is also immoral</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Capitalism and Inequality."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0080/"}}
