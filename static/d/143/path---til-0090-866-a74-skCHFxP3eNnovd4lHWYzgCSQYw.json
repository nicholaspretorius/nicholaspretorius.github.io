{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Some of the times the thoughts, ideas and lessons come easily and you can write about them. At others they don't. Leaving work today, I was pretty demotivated. The project I am working on is challenging, but it was not that what got me down, it was the fact that it seems like the team as a whole is increasingly resigned to the state of the project. Like it is becoming accepted that things are tough and that's just how it will be and we have to live with it. It seems to me the focus is more on problems than solutions, and that's not a corner one wants to take. </p>\n<p>Regardless, I have recently been going wakeskating again. For those who don't know, wakeskating is like wakeboarding, just without the bindings. And the lesson for today, if there is one, is that no matter how demotivated you might feel, going out and doing something you enjoy straight after that is the best remedy. Focus on something else and the problems will lose their edge and your mind and body will soon return to a place where the solutions take priority over the problems.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Remotivate."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0090/"}}
