{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I first came across the <a href=\"https://www.therooststand.com/\">Roost Laptop Stand</a> after reading a <a href=\"https://krausefx.com/blog/going-nomad\">blog post</a> by Felix Krause where he mentioned it (see the section titled \"Did you buy any travel gear for this?\"). </p>\n<p>I was really impressed by the stand after taking a look at some information on it. Despite making a mental note to check it out, I promptly forgot about. </p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, Tim Ferris mentioned the Roost Laptop Stand in his <a href=\"https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday-1/\">5-Bullet Friday</a> newsletter and I was reminded of it once more. Over the past year, I have spent a considerable amount of time working on a laptop, and due to some bad posture and bad sitting habits, I have picked up back pain that has caused me quite some discomfort in recent months. As a result, after taking another look at some reviews, I decided to take the plunge and order one from Amazon. I am looking forward to this piece of kit! While it won't make me a better developer, I sure hope it will help my posture!</p>\n<p>Note: I originally wanted to order the stand directly from Roost, but the shipping was more than the stand itself!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Roost Laptop Stand."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0151/"}}
