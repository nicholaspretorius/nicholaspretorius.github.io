{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have been experimenting with Glide Apps over the past few days. Basically, Glide offers the opportunity to generate mobile apps using Google Sheets as a data source. Glide offers a wonderfully intuitive user experience when building apps. There are however, some items I would love to see: </p>\n<h3>Filters.</h3>\n<p>Currently, Glide offers a \"Search\" component, it would however, be amazing to provide filter buttons to update the view based on certain criteria. For example, you can currently provide a list of items, however, would it not be great to enable a switching mechanism based on a field with a specific set of values. For example, if you had an internal app listing project, the \"main\" view would show a listing of all the projects. However, you could have a \"Status\" colum, with enum values such as \"In Progress\" and \"Live\". Based on that, you could then offer buttons, to toggle the view between listings that were \"Live\" or \"In Progress\" etc. </p>\n<h3>Map &#x26; Location.</h3>\n<p>The addition of the Map component is fantastic, however, it would be even better if the Map listing could be delimited to a specified area from the user's current location (if enabled) or based on a location entered by the user. This is a fairly common use case in terms of map/location based activities. </p>\n<h3>Instragram Video.</h3>\n<p>Instagram video is becoming a very large part of video distribution, as such, it would be fantastic to have the ability to display/embed an Instragram video within an app. For example, specifiy a video column, then based on the url, could display a player for a YouTube, Vimeo or Instagram video. </p>\n<p>To be continued...</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Glide Apps."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post059/"}}
