{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have been a great fan and listener of Audible since 2015. I am currently busy with my 44th title. If you are not a customer, the way it works is, you sign up for the service and you pay a certain amount for credits. I am on the plan where you get 1 credit a month. 1 credit can then get you any audiobook you like, whether it is 1 hr long or 100 hours. You can of course purchase more credits if you would like to listen to more than your one book per month. I tend to buy books in the region of 15-40 hours, so typically, I am a credit or two behind since, I will not likely finish a book in a month if it is a long one 30-40 hours or so. </p>\n<p>I do however, wonder how an audiobook subscription fee, in the Netflix, all-you-can-listen style would fare? </p>\n<p>I would care less about listening time, and would likely start to widen the variety of books I listen to. For example, there are often books in the history/non-fiction/business type categories that I am interested in listening to, but since they tend to be quite short, I avoid them since then I would soon be out of credit. A system like that would also be more attuned to giving up on books you were not particularly enjoying. </p>\n<p>With Apple's big push into services, it seems like an audiobook subscription service might be a way for them to differentiate their books offering from what Amazon offers. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Audiobook Subscription."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post031/"}}
