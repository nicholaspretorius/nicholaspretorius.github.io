{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The JBL Charge 4 is a great portable speaker. About the length and half the height of a regular toaster. It packs a pretty good punch when it comes to sound and volume. Little light on the treble, but the bass comes through well and in all honesty, for the price, it's a great piece of hardware. The pairing works easily, the battery lasts ages and to my ears, the quality is good enough for my purposes. </p>\n<p>While I have no use for it as I only have 1 speaker, but you can connect and sync multiple Charge 4s together which sounds like a great idea if you have more than one available. It does not have any smart features or personal assistant, however, I was only looking for a speaker that I can take with me on road trips and make use of in Airbnb rentals and the like. </p>\n<p>I was also impressed with quality of the packaging. The box is strudy with a nice, solid fitting foam interior that fits snugly around the speaker and protects it well. The charging cable and booklets are contained in a nice little black bock that slides into the side. What I really liked about the box was that it has a magnetic folding side so it snaps shut making it a pretty good substiture for a hardcase. Seems to me JBL have taken at least a page out of the old Apple packaging playbook. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"JBL Charge 4."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post038/"}}
