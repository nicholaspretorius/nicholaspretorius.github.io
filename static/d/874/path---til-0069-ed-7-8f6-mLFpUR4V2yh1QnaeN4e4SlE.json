I am happy to report that, having now understood the problem, it easy to refactor the solutions using more modern ES6 constructs such as .filter, .reduce and .map. </p>\n<h4>Lessons Learned.</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Once you have a solution, it becomes easier to reason about improvements if you have an idea of what avenues you have for improvement. </li>\n<li>Tests really help you find bugs in your code! (During the refactor, after my first pass I thought I had a successful refactor, but a failing test showed me that I had a flaw in my reasoning!)</li>\n<li>It helps to step through your failing code step by step to understand where and why you are going wrong! </li>\n<li>You cannot use a conditional inside of .reduce, you first need to .filter your set on the condition you have in mind and then .reduce from there. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>All things considered, I still feel a long way off from being half-way decent at algorightms, but I am making progress, no matter how <a href=\"https://github.com/nicholaspretorius/dcp/blob/master/solutions/dcp02.js\">small the steps</a>! </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mo' Coding Problems Refactored."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til0069/"}}
