Then as the team-lead for the local Java development team and ultimately moving to\n      the Java/Digital Hub Team where I was the lead developer for the “Service Online” project. As\n      of my departure, “Service Online” was operating in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand,\n      Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and numerous markets in the Middle East. During my time on that\n      project, I worked remotely from Barcelona for a year.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <h4>Service Online.</h4>\n    <p>\n      This was an AngularJs single-page application built on top of the CDK “Service Online” API. It\n      supported the booking and management of service bookings for BMW and MINI owners. The\n      application was fully responsive, fully translatable, with all copy able to be customised to\n      local market requirements. We supported 3 languages including right-to-left (RTL) layouts in\n      Arabic. The application appeared in 2 different corporate identities for BMW and MINI with a\n      customised look and feel for both brands. The app further supported numerous other feature\n      flags and options dependent on local market requirements. After our initial pilot, I moved the\n      application from a SUSE Linux environment to Microsoft Azure. I was responsible for all Azure\n      related activities for the application. After 2.5 years, a new developer joined the team and\n      along with him I oversaw the migration of the app to the LTS version of AngularJs (1.7), the\n      integration of unit tests, the addition of an automated build/release pipeline via Azure\n      DevOps as well as the concept proposal for the creation of a new admin area for markets to\n      manage their content directly.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Throughout the course of the project I was involved in all aspects of development, design,\n      documentation, presentations, sprint planning and numerous other activities including research\n      and exploration of project expansion opportunities which included presenting our project at\n      the annual BMW IT Fair in Munich. This presentation resulted in project interest from BMW\n      regions covering markets in Europe and North Africa. During this time I also provided support,\n      technical diagrams and a fully documented Postman collection for a US based development team\n      which was integrating the CDK API into the BMW Connected App.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Project Elements:</strong> AngularJs, Node.js (with Express, Nodemailer and Handlebars\n      templates), HTML/Less, Google Maps, Azure DevOps, Azure App Service, Let’s Encrypt SSL,\n      mockups in Balsamiq, design in Photoshop and presentations in InVision. Workflow diagrams.\n      Postman collections/API documentation.\n    </p>\n    <h4>Online Sales.</h4>\n    <p>\n      I was a senior developer on the team responsible for building out an AngularJs component\n      library to be used in the parent Online Sales project which was a priority project for BMW\n      Germany with markets in the UK, Germany and China. The component library covered all UI\n      elements to be used in the application and to be available in 3 corporate identities for BMW,\n      BMW-Motorrad and MINI. All components needed to support translation. The components were built\n      from scratch using HTML/SCSS and AngularJs and published as a private NPM package. I was\n      responsible for development of components, code review and mentoring the junior developers on\n      the team. All source code was hosted in BitBucket with all work items being tracked in Jira.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I was also involved in a separate branch of the same project where we conducted a pilot\n      project for UX testing and analysis. This involved travelling to Munich, Germany and running\n      workshops and UX testing with stakeholders in Germany. We conducted a variety of tests\n      including card sorts, interviews and observation tests.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Project Elements:</strong> AngularJs/Typescript, HTML/SCSS, code review (BitBucket),\n      UX testing.\n    </p>\n    <h4>BMW Digital Showroom.</h4>\n    <p>\n      I created wireframes and worked closely with the designer to get the application from concept\n      through to approval. While I did not do the AngularJs development on this project, I worked\n      closely with our Java/AngularJs developer and coded numerous portions of the front-end HTML\n      and CSS and oversaw many of the UI aspects of the project. Prior to launch, I was also\n      responsible for conceiving of and setting up the Google Analytics tracking and reporting. Post\n      launch I was responsible for the pilot implementation of a “use my location” feature,\n      inherited some design responsibilities as well as shared AngularJs development\n      responsibilities for several enhancements.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Project Elements:</strong> Wireframes, HTML/Less, AngularJs (created front-end\n      components for JS developer to integrate), Google Analytics development, Google Analytics\n      reporting.\n    </p>\n    <h4>BMW Blog.</h4>\n    <p>\n      I created the wireframes, working closely with the designer to get all designs approved. From\n      there I handled all back-end WordPress/PHP development work (custom plugin and\n      login/registration integration) as well as front-end HTML/CSS and JavaScript development\n      (custom theme and forum theme). The BMW Blog integrated custom APIs to bring in user data and\n      manage registration and login.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Project Elements:</strong> Wireframes, PHP/WordPress development, custom theme and\n      plugin development.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>B1 (Internal Team Blog).</h4>\n    <p>\n      On my arrival to the team, I was frustrated by the use of folders containing Word documents to\n      document team information and processes. As a result, I setup a WordPress site to which all\n      team members could post in order to record and store the shared knowledge of the team. During\n      this time I wrote over 100 posts detailing all kinds of development and process related\n      information for our team.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Other.</h4>\n    <p>\n      During my time at the BMW Group, I was involved in numerous high-level projects for all BMW\n      Group brands both locally and internationally. Other notable projects included work for the\n      BMW Plant App in San Luis-Potosi in Mexico, the expansion of the Digital Showroom project to\n      include BMW-Motorrad in Russia as well as support and handover for the teams rolling out the\n      expansion of the the Digital Showroom to MINI and BMW-Motorrad locally. I designed and\n      developed the Admin UI for our in-house dealer website CMS. I was deeply involved in the\n      development of the front-ends for the BMW and MINI front-ends to all dealer websites as well\n      as the migrations of corporate identities for both brands. I also developed the front-end UI\n      and validation for all lead generation forms across several generations of corporate identity\n      for multiple brands as well as custom one off UIs. I was also heavily involved in the creation\n      and development of several iterations of dealer locators, multiple generations of the BMW,\n      MINI and Alphera finance websites as well as playing a overseeing role during the re-alignment\n      process for the group customer portals.\n    </p>\n  </Container>\n);\n","const preferDefault = m => (m && m.default) || m\n\nif (process.env.BUILD_STAGE === `develop`) {\n  module.exports = preferDefault(require(`./public-page-renderer-dev`))\n} else if (process.env.BUILD_STAGE === `build-javascript`) {\n  module.exports = preferDefault(require(`./public-page-renderer-prod`))\n} else {\n  module.exports = () => null\n}\n","import React from \"react\"\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\"\nimport Link, {\n  withPrefix,\n  navigate,\n  push,\n  replace,\n  navigateTo,\n} from \"gatsby-link\"\nimport PageRenderer from \"./public-page-renderer\"\nimport parsePath from \"./parse-path\"\n\nconst StaticQueryContext = React.createContext({})\n\nconst StaticQuery = props => (\n  <StaticQueryContext.Consumer>\n    {staticQueryData => {\n      if (\n        props.data ||\n        (staticQueryData[props.query] && staticQueryData[props.query].data)\n      ) {\n        return (props.render || props.children)(\n          props.data ? props.data.data : staticQueryData[props.query].data\n        )\n      } else {\n        return <div>Loading (StaticQuery)</div>\n      }\n    }}\n  </StaticQueryContext.Consumer>\n)\n\nStaticQuery.propTypes = {\n  data: PropTypes.object,\n  query: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n  render: PropTypes.func,\n  children: PropTypes.func,\n}\n\nfunction graphql() {\n  throw new Error(\n    `It appears like Gatsby is misconfigured.
