Read it three times. </li>\n<li>Write the way you talk. Naturally. </li>\n<li>Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs. </li>\n<li>Never use jargon words like <em>reconceptualize</em>, <em>demassification</em>, <em>attitudinally</em>, <em>judgmentally</em>. They are hallmarks of a pretensious ass. </li>\n<li>Never write more than two pages on any subject. </li>\n<li>Check your quotations.</li>\n<li>Never send a letter or memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning - then edit it. </li>\n<li>If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it. </li>\n<li>Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do. </li>\n<li>If you want ACTION, don't write. Go and tell the guy what you want. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>In my experience, workplace email culture often fails dismally on points: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"TIL 0035"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/til0035/"}}}});
