developer to the BMW Group South Africa I worked as: <br />\n      <br />\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          Front-end developer working closely with the Java development team across a variety of\n          applications\n        </li>\n        <li>Team lead for the Java development team working closely with the design team</li>\n        <li>\n          JavaScript developer for the Java/Digital Hub Team. In that team I worked on a variety of\n          projects: <br />\n          <ul>\n            <li>Primarily, I was the lead developer for the “Service Online” project. </li>\n            <li>A senior frontend developer for the Online Sales components project. </li>\n            <li>Frontend developer for various projects for muktiple markets. </li>\n          </ul>\n          <br />\n          As of my departure, my primary project “Service Online” was operating in South Africa,\n          Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and numerous markets in the Middle\n          East. During my time on that project, I worked remotely from Barcelona for a year.{\" \"}\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </p>\n    <h4>Service Online.</h4>\n    <p>\n      An AngularJs single-page application built on top of the CDK “Service Online” API. It\n      supported the booking and management of service bookings for BMW and MINI owners:{\" \"}\n    </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>The application was mobile responsive</li>\n      <li>Fully translatable, with all copy able to be customised to local market requirements</li>\n      <li>We supported 3 languages including right-to-left (RTL) layouts in Arabic</li>\n      <li>\n        The application appeared in 2 different corporate identities for BMW and MINI with a\n        customised look and feel for both brands\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      The app further supported numerous other feature flags and options dependent on local market\n      requirements. After our initial pilot, I moved the application from a SUSE Linux environment\n      to Microsoft Azure. I was responsible for all Azure related activities for the application.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      When a new developer joined the team, I oversaw the:\n      <ul>\n        <li>Migration of the app to the LTS version of AngularJs (1.7)</li>\n        <li>Integration of unit tests</li>\n        <li>Addition of an automated build/release pipeline via Azure DevOps</li>\n        <li>\n          Concept proposal for the creation of a new admin area for markets to manage their content\n          directly\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </p>\n    <p>Throughout the course of the project I was involved in all aspects of: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Development</li>\n      <li>Design</li>\n      <li>Documentation</li>\n      <li>Presentations</li>\n      <li>Sprint planning</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>\n      I also undertook numerous other activities including research and exploration of project\n      expansion opportunities which included presenting our project at the annual BMW IT Fair in\n      Munich. This presentation resulted in project interest from BMW regions covering markets in\n      Europe and North Africa.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      During this time I also provided support, technical diagrams and a fully documented Postman\n      collection for a US based development team which was integrating the CDK API into the BMW\n      Connected App.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Project Elements:</strong> AngularJs, Node.js (with Express, Nodemailer and Handlebars\n      templates), HTML/Less, Google Maps, Azure DevOps, Azure App Service, Let’s Encrypt SSL,\n      mockups in Balsamiq, design in Photoshop/Sketch and presentations in InVision. Workflow\n      diagrams. Postman collections/API documentation.\n    </p>\n    <h4>Online Sales.</h4>\n    <p>\n      I was a senior developer on the team responsible for building out an AngularJs/TypeScript\n      component library to be used in the parent Online Sales project which was a priority project\n      for BMW Germany with markets in the UK, Germany and China.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The component library covered all UI elements to be used in the application and to be\n      available in 3 corporate identities for BMW, BMW-Motorrad and MINI. All components needed to\n      support translation. The components were built from scratch using HTML/SCSS and AngularJs and\n      published as a private NPM package. I was responsible for development of components, code\n      review and mentoring the junior developers on the team. All source code was hosted in\n      BitBucket with all work items being tracked in Jira.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I was also involved in a separate branch of the same project where we conducted a pilot\n      project for UX testing and analysis. This involved travelling to Munich, Germany and running\n      workshops and UX testing with stakeholders in Germany. We conducted a variety of tests\n      including card sorts, interviews and observation tests.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Project Elements:</strong> AngularJs/Typescript, HTML/SCSS, code review (BitBucket),\n      UX testing.\n    </p>\n    <h4>BMW Digital Showroom.</h4>\n    <p>\n      I played a leading role in the design and development of the BMW Digital Showroom project.\n      Playing multiple roles in this project, I took part in:\n    </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Created wireframes and worked closely with the designer to get the application from concept\n        through to approval\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Worked closely with our Java/AngularJs developer and developed numerous portions of the\n        front-end HTML, CSS and JavaScript\n      </li>\n      <li>Oversaw many of the UI aspects of the project</li>\n      <li>Conceiving of and setting up the Google Analytics tracking and reporting</li>\n      <li>I was responsible for the pilot implementation of a “use my location” feature</li>\n      <li>Handled design for several features</li>\n      <li>Shared AngularJs development responsibilities for several enhancements.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Project Elements:</strong> AngularJs (created front-end components for JS developer to\n      integrate), Google Analytics development, Google Analytics reporting, HTML/Less, Wireframes,\n      post-launch design work.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>BMW Blog.</h4>\n    <p>\n      As the primary developer on this project, I created wireframes and worked closely with the\n      designer to get all designs approved. From there I handled all:{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Backend WordPress/PHP development work (custom plugin and login/registration integration)\n      </li>\n      <li>Frontend HTML/CSS and JavaScript development (custom and forum themes)</li>\n      <li>Lead Java developers in work required for the registration and login API</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>\n      The BMW Blog integrated custom APIs to bring in user data and manage registration and login.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Project Elements:</strong> PHP, WordPress and JavaScript development, custom theme and\n      plugin development. Wireframes.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>B1 (Internal Team Blog).</h4>\n    <p>\n      On my arrival to the team, I was frustrated by the use of folders containing Word documents to\n      document team information and processes. As a result, I setup a WordPress site to which all\n      team members could post in order to record and store the shared knowledge of the team. During\n      this time I wrote over 100 posts detailing all kinds of development and process related\n      information for our team.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Other.</h4>\n    <p>\n      During my time at the BMW Group, I was involved in numerous high-level projects for all BMW\n      Group brands both locally and internationally.
