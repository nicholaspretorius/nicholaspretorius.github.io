The <a href=\"https://hr.nih.gov/working-nih/competencies/competencies-proficiency-scale\">NIH Competencies Proficiency Scale</a>. Essentially, your proficiency is broken down into 5 levels: </p>\n<h1>Their words:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fundamental Awareness (basic knowledge) </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have a common knowledge or an understanding of basic techniques and concepts. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Novice (limited experience) </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have the level of experience gained in the classroom or as a trainee. </li>\n<li>You are expected to need help performing this skill. </li>\n<li>You understand and can discuss terminology, concepts, principles and issues related to this competency. </li>\n<li>You utilize the full range of reference and resource materials in this competency. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intermediate (practical application)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are able to successfully complete tasks in this competency as requested. </li>\n<li>Help from an expert may be required from time to time, but you can usually perform the skill independently. </li>\n<li>You have applied this competency to situations occassionally while needing minimal guidance to perform successfully. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advanced (applied theory)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can perform the actions associated with this skill without assistance. </li>\n<li>You are certainly recognized within your immediate organization as a \"person to ask\" when difficult questions arise regarding this skill. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expert (recognized authority) </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are known as an expert in this area. </li>\n<li>You can provide guidance, troubleshoot and answer questions related to this area of expertise and the field where the skill is used.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>My words:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fundamental awareness</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have watched a Udemy course or two on the topic and you can start to incorporate this into your own work. </li>\n<li>You will need to Google and Stack Exchange. A lot.  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Novice</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You know enough to start. </li>\n<li>You can cobble things together, figure them out as you go but chances are good you will be spending a lot of time on things, that a more experienced developer will solve quite quickly. </li>\n<li>Trial and error is a big part of your repertoire. </li>\n<li>You are primarily concerned with getting something to work rather than to work well. </li>\n<li>You don't know what you don't know. </li>\n<li>Your ability to read and comprehend code is limited. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intermediate</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can build stuff and you know enough to have opinions on what you have built (good and bad). </li>\n<li>You refer more to the MDN and developer docs directly, because you are looking for the <em>gist</em>. </li>\n<li>You understand the building blocks and are looking for information that is more directional, than it is specific. </li>\n<li>Likely, once you have built a few things, you will start to recognise the short-comings of your implementations and become more concerned with patterns, structure, efficiency and style. </li>\n<li>Importantly, you can, for the most part, solve your own problems. </li>\n<li>You are becoming aware of what you don't know, you have pretty good ideas on what you need to get better at.</li>\n<li>You know bad code when you see it, but you aren't thoroughly versed in how to improve it - you know it should be improved and you have some ideas to go on. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advanced</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have been round the block more than a few times. </li>\n<li>You can solve small problems quite quickly and most importantly, you can solve hard problems others are struggling with. </li>\n<li>Your code is generally well structured, well written and hopefully shows good style. </li>\n<li>People tend to call on you to help solve issues they are facing. </li>\n<li>You know bad code when you see it and you immediately have solid suggestions and approaches to improving it.  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expert</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are solving problems most people don't even know exist. </li>\n<li>You are creating what everyone else uses. </li>\n<li>You are likely proficient in more than one language and could pick another up quickly. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",frontmatter:{title:"TIL 0042"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/til0042/"}}}});
