### Web.Config exception, Ng-Map miscellaneous and Hotel.

* If you want to exclude a specific folder from a blanket redirect rule in Web.Config and this to your &lt;condition&gt;
<pre>&lt;add input="{URL}" pattern="/path/folder/.*$" negate="true" ignoreCase="true" /&gt;</pre>
* When using the AngularJS plugin Ng-Map, you can lazy load Google Maps - Make sure not include the regular Google Maps script in your HTML | [Link](https://ngmap.github.io/#/!map-lazy-load-params.html)
* If you want to initialise the map in Ng-Map based on an action you can do this | [Link](https://ngmap.github.io/#/!map-lazy-inint.html)
* Hotel is a nifty utility that lets you launch your local servers from one place npm install -g hotel && hotel start | [Link](https://github.com/typicode/hotel)
* Then run: hotel add http://localhost:3000 (or whatever your server is)
