### Git, Azure and Deploying a AngularJS app from VS Code

* If you are working behind a corporate proxy, first setup Git for this: git config --global http.proxy http://username:password@proxy:port
* Check it looks right: git config --global --get http.proxy
* You can also unset it: git config --global --unset http.proxy
* In the Azure portal, select your App Service, then select Deployment Options and configure your local Git as a deployment source. Take note of your deployment credentials
* git checkout your-branch
* Add your azure instance as a remote via: git remote add azure https://your.provided.azure.git
* Check that the remote added by running: git remote -v
* Since the AngularJS app runs from the dist folder,  you will need to: touch .deployment | code .deployment <br/>
<pre>
    [config]
    folder = dist
</pre>
* You will also need to remove the dist/ line from your .gitignore
* git add --all 
* git commit -m ".deployment for deploying from repo to Azure. Update .gitignore for this purpose. Adding /dist"
* git push azure your-branch
* Note that Azure deploys from the master branch by default, to change this, you can add an Azure App Setting on your App Service called deployment_branch with the name of your-branch. Remember to stop and start your App Service once this has been done. 
* Once your push has been successful, check your App Service URL. 
* Next steps: Use Deployment Slots to manage moving your Development service through Staging/UAT to Production.
