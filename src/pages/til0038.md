### One of those days

First day of a new month. It seems to me that while we are adopting agile, we are still very much in a waterfall mindset. I imagine it will take some time to move through this. In any event, the day was spent mostly working on estimates on unknowns far in advance. Something I wonder is how do developments teams trying to work agile quote for departments that expect waterfall? 

The very nature of providing a quote for work to be done, on a system to be built to completion for departments that have set budgets that they have to spend in a set amount of time with expectations of delivery of a highly specified product that looks good in a PowerPoint inevitably leads to waterfall. 

Something to think about...
