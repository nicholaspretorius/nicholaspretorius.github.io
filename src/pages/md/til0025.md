* Nodemailer-express-handlebars is a useful plugin for Nodemailer that allows you to use Handlebars templates in your HTML emails | [Link](https://github.com/yads/nodemailer-express-handlebars) <br/>
The documentation on that page does not provide a full usage example and is really short on details. I then found this article which was incredibly helpful! | [Link](http://excellencenodejsblog.com/express-nodemailer-sending-mails/)
<pre>
...
var hbs = require('nodemailer-express-handlebars');
var options = {
    viewEngine : {
        extname: '.hbs', // handlebars extension
        layoutsDir: 'views/email/', // location of handlebars templates
        defaultLayout: 'template', // name of main template
        partialsDir: 'views/email/', // location of your subtemplates aka. header, footer etc
    },
    viewPath: 'views/email',
    extName: '.hbs'
};
...
mailer.use('compile', hbs(options));
mailer.sendMail({
    from: 'test@test.com',
    to: req.body.to,
    subject: req.body.subject,
    template: 'template',
    context: {
        firstName: req.body.firstName,
        lastName: req.body.lastName,
        ...
    }
}, function(error, response)...)

* Most of my day was then spent trying to figure out how best to put Node.js, Express and its dependencies into a working app via Webpack. I have not been very successful so far... My main issue at present is that when I run Webpack I get a lot of errors that say things like: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './decode/' etc <br/>
I did however, find two articles which look promising and that I will be picking for clues: 
<br/><br/>
1. TypeScript, Express and Node.js | [Link](http://brianflove.com/2016/11/08/typescript-2-express-node/) <br/>
This is a great article, however, he uses Grunt to build his TypeScript which is not quite what I am looking for. 
2. TypeScript, ExpressJS API with Webpack | [Link](https://medium.com/@Pierre_anthill/typescript-expressjs-api-with-webpack-4655126d884b)<br/>
Another great article that look to cover most of what I am looking for.
