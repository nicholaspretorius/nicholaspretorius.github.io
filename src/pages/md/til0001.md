* Launch VS Code from the command line | [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) 
* VS Code key binding for moving a line up or down is: <pre>Alt + Up or Alt + Down</pre>
* I started learning about TypeScript and the first step is: <pre>npm install -g typescript</pre>
* That the awesome Emmet is installed by default in VS Code | [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/08/07/emmet-2.0)
* Are you a Git rookie like me? This is how you delete a branch on local: <pre>git branch -d oldBranch01 oldBranch02 oldBranch03</pre>
