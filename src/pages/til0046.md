As we reach the end of the year, and work slows down that little bit, we have a brief moment to reflect, reset and refocus. For me, that starts with starting to pick up on some of where I left off. Writing, both words and code.

At present, I am working on a rudimentary Todo API using Nest.js. You can find it here: [Itemly](https://github.com/nicholaspretorius/itemly)

* The idea here is try and build an improved habit for writing cleaner, more modular code, better tests and documenting in Swagger and Typedoc. 
* What I have written so far has been from following the examples in the [Nest.js documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/) as well as taking some cues from other repos.
