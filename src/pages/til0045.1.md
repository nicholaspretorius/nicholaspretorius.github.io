While I missed posting about this earlier this year (this post has been backdates and manually entered after the fact), I wanted to make a mention of it regardless. 

Stack Exchange has been an (almost) daily companion for me in my day to day work as a developer. I could not count the number of times Stack Exchange has provided me with the answers I was looking for. Admittedly, I am more of a consumer, than a contributor (which is a subject for another post, another time). However, I did finally endeavour to post my first [Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51373464/nodejs-error-listen-eaddrinuse-3000/52137477#52137477) this year. An incredibly minor achievement, and likely not worth a mention to most, but still, I feel like it's a step in the right direction! 

So far it has amassed a grand total of 1 up-votes! :)
