In the spirit of reflection on the year passed. (This post has been backdated and added after the fact.) 

I made my first (tiny) [commit](https://github.com/howtographql/howtographql/pull/617) to open source - particularly, the site Howtographql. It really is not anything to shout about, but I felt it was worth mentioning. A journey of a thousand steps start with the smallest step! (Even if that step was 8 moths ago!) :O
