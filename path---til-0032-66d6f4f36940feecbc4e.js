Setting high goals with a demanding schedule and uncertain circumstances has been a challenge.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes it can be a struggle to reach these goals. Since one learns more, one realises how much more there is to learn. It feels at times, that I am not entered into a race as much as a triathlon: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improving my skills as a JavaScript developer. </li>\n<li>Learning Node.js to add backend JavaScript skills to my repertoire. </li>\n<li>Learning cloud and server managments in order to better adopt the devops role I now play. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Above all of these, trying to improve as colleague, teammate and human being overall.</p>\n<p>While I have no doubt that my skills are improving, some days, I feel as if progress has ground to a halt. One starts to focus on the gap between what is, and where one wants to get to. In that light, I thought it time to reflect on some of what I have learned about in the past year: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become the lead (and for 95% of the time) only developer on a small but growing, international project.</li>\n<li>Built a multi-lingual, multi-directional interface (LTR - RTL).</li>\n<li>Taken responsiblity for the hosting and management of hosting for the project.</li>\n<li>Learned/learning to use Git daily after using Subversion for many years. </li>\n<li>Using Atlassian tools such as BitBucket, Jira and Confluence daily.</li>\n<li>Learning Azure and working hard to upskill myself in devops.</li>\n<li>Learning Node.js in order to deliver backend JavaScript functionality and APIs.</li>\n<li>Learned Sketch in order to mockup/design interfaces.</li>\n<li>Trying React in order to see what is out there other than AngularJS. (Angular, TypeScript, Unit Testing... all the things still to come)</li>\n<li>Learned to navigate my way around Linux, generating CSRs/SSLs, getting increasingly comfortable with the command line. </li>\n<li>Implemented app and server updates in order to meet Penetration/Security Test criteria.</li>\n<li>Spent some time learning Java in order to get a better handle on the language, environment and mindset the larger company works in. </li>\n<li>Adopting Agile in project and team work. </li>\n<li>Becoming increasingly efficient on a Mac (after a lifetime of Windows usage).</li>\n<li>Working remotely. </li>\n<li>Taking reponsibility, ownership and trying to improve my work in general. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is still a mountain to climb and most likely a further mountain range behind it. Here's to the journey, more than the destination! </p>",frontmatter:{title:"TIL 0032"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/til0032/"}}}});
